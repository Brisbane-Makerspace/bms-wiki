# Asset Purchases
It's always exciting to buy a shiny new (or used!) asset such as a tool or piece of infrastructure. However, we must follow the procedures and requirements in this policy to prevent future problems.

## What is covered by this policy
Any tool, resource, or piece of infrastructure that is to be made available for general use by the membership of BMS Inc. and has a combined cost of purchase/installation greater than $200, is required to follow this policy.

To avoid confusion, a "new asset" is considered to be anything that is "new to BMS" and includes used / second-hand assets and leased assets. Consumables are specifically excluded from this policy.

## Accountable Team
Each asset requires an accountable team. This team is accountable for performing maintenance and repairs, keeping documentation up to date, and running inductions. A team becomes an accountable team if they agree (by vote at a team meeting) to become an accountable team and there isn't already one.

## Process for purchasing a new asset
**When deciding upon an asset (which will typically be a tool) to purchase, the most important factors are:**
1. How easy it is for the average member to use (ease of use should be preferred over more capable machines).
2. The value it brings to the organisation as a whole, not just a small number of members.
3. Is it going to improve our capabilities in a meaningful way and get used, or is it just a "shiny new tool"?
4. Is the value that the asset brings enough to justify the ongoing maintenance and costs?

**The following requirements must be met before the purchase of a new asset can be voted on:**
1. A fully costed installation/maintenance plan must be completed and presented with the purchase proposal. This must include all additional infrastructure and installation costs required to make the asset operational. It must also include the typical costs associated with consumables and maintenance over the life of the asset.
2. The proposed asset must have an accountable team.
3. *Every* asset the accountable team is responsible for must be fully operational (assets that are waiting on parts or a third party for repair are exempt), and must meet the documentation standards.

**The following requirements must be met before the machine can be purchased / funds transferred (but this may happen after the vote is approved):**
1. All documentation of the asset must be complete and published on the wiki. This documentation must meet the standards defined in the documentation section below.
2. The induction checklist and process must be complete (as much as reasonably possible without the asset being present).

## Abandoned Assets
**An asset becomes abandoned if any of the following becomes true:**
* A team votes to stop being accountable for an asset at a team meeting.
* An asset has been unavailable or unusable to most members for a continuous period of 3 months without a reasonable excuse. This must be ratified by a vote at a team meeting, executive meeting, or general meeting.
* A resolution at a general or executive meeting deems an asset as abandoned.

**Once an asset becomes abandoned the following process occurs:**
1. The accountable team is deemed no longer accountable for the asset.
2. The asset should be moved to storage or another location inaccessible by the general membership.
3. The asset should be removed from any prominent locations of advertisement such as on the website or flyers.
4. The asset is no longer allowed to be advertised to potential new members (such as during tours or workshops).
5. The wiki page must be updated with a banner in a prominent location saying that the asset has been abandoned and cannot be used.
6. If a team does not become accountable for the asset within 60 days of it becoming abandoned, it must be sold or disposed of.

If a team becomes accountable for an asset before it is disposed of, the abandoned asset process should be undone.

## Asset Documentation Standards
Every asset should contain as much documentation as possible, however, the following minimum standards apply for every asset:
1. A wiki page containing the following:
    1. The name and a photograph of the asset.
    2. A summary of recommended uses for the asset.
    3. The manufacturer, and the most important specifications (like work area, max operating speed, etc.)
    4. Any quirks, special features, or things to watch out for.
    5. The full induction process, including a detailed checklist of things the induction should cover.
    6. Simple Just In Time (JIT) documentation outlining core steps before, during, and after using the asset - this can be a simple list.
    7. A list of commonly used consumables/materials and where to buy them from.
2. A printed out and laminated summary of the tool including:
    1. Its name/photo.
    2. Its cost (if any).
    2. A link / QR code to the wiki page.
    3. The JIT documentation.
