# Introduction
In order to maintain a safe operating environment, Brisbane Makerspace requires members to undertake training (called an induction) before they can use some tools. We use a 3 level traffic light system to indicate the different requirements. These are "Green Tool", "Orange Tool", and "Red Tool".

Members are **not allowed to operate a tool**  if they have not completed the induction requirements. If a member attempts to use a tool without meeting it's induction requirements, their membership will likely be terminated.

*Every* tool has either an A4 label with a written note stating the tool's colour, or it will have a small colour coded label. For example, the A4 printer has a green coloured label on it, indicating that it's a "Green Tool" and the laser cutter has an A4 label that says "Orange Tool" on it.

If a tool does not have a label on it, then it has been deemed very low risk and it doesn't required documentation or induction (for example, scissors). Scan the QR code on a tool's label to read it's wiki page.

# Green Tool
These tools require no special induction as they have been deemed low risk. Members are allowed to use these tools without any special training requirements. It is still a requirement to read and understand it's wiki page.

# Orange Tool
These tools have been deemed medium risk, and a formal induction is required. There are two types of inductions and a tool may require either or both of them. These are an online component (usually a short video and quiz), and an in person component where you are asked to demonstrate your competency at operating the tool to a staff member.

Each Orange Tool is different, so you should carefully read it's wiki page to understand it's induction requirements.

# Red Tool
This is a high risk tool. Members are not allowed to operate Red Tool tools by themselves unless they have been given permission by staff. However, our staff are more than happy to assist you by either operating this tool for you, or supervising your use of it.

We generally encourage members to take advantage of our [Job Completion Service](/services/job-completion) for Red Tools. By using this service, we'll take care of your job for you and let you know when it's ready to pick up.
