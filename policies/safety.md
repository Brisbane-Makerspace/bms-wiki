# Introduction
You can't work on projects when you're injured! But also, it's no fun for anyone. At Brisbane Makerspace, safety is extremely important and is our top priority. In an environment like ours, there are certain risks that a lot of people aren't normally exposed to.

## Safety Incidents
If a safety incident occurs, no matter how small, it must be reported to staff. We will try to capture as many details as possible and keep a record of it, so we can improve our documentation and procedures.

## Safety Risks
You must not do, or fail to do, anything that poses an unacceptable risk to safety. Anything you see that may become, or already is a risk to safety, must be reported to staff immediately.

If you see someone about to do something that poses an unacceptable risk to safety, you should politely but firmly advise them to stop and explain why. If this happens, please let staff know so we can improve our documentation and procedures.

## Tools
The use of any tool poses certain risks. Some are low risk like a pair of scissors, and others are high risk such as our laser cutter. We try to reduce the chances of any safety incidents happening through extensive training, documentation, and procedures.

It is a requirement before using a tool for the first time, that you read it's wiki page and complete any required inductions. Some very low risk tools (like scissors or rulers) may not have a wiki page, but it's still important to be safe when using them. Our [Tool Inductions](/policies/inductions) policy explains how our traffic light induction system works.

Every tool with a wiki page has a label attached with it's name and a QR code. Scanning this QR code will take you to it's wiki page. Alternatively, you can use the search feature on the wiki to find it.

Some tools have a specific procedure that must be followed every time you use the tool. A summary of the most important steps is attached to some of these tools and is called "just in time documentation" (or JIT document for short). If you see a JIT document, you are required to follow all relevant steps at a minimum.

## Clothing and PPE
Due to the various hazards that exist at Brisbane Makerspace, we require everyone on site to wear closed in shoes (sandles etc. are not permitted). We recommend that you remove jewellery and tie up long hair before working with tools.

We have a range of basic PPE such as safety glasses and gloves. You are encouraged to bring your own PPE as it's likely to be more comfortable and better fitting. We require that you wear appropriate PPE at all times.

## Tidy Workspaces
All workspaces must be left clean and tidy both during, and after, you are using them. An untidy workspace is a common cause of safety incidents and should be avoided.

## Chemicals
Due to the nature of the tools and resources available at Brisbane Makerspace, we sometimes have to deal with chemicals. We have requirements in place to ensure we maintain a safe workshop and that we have the necessary documentation in the event of an incident involving chemicals.

All chemicals that are bought on site by either staff or members **must** have an MSDS inserted into the MSDS folder near the sign in area. In addition, prior to bringing a new chemical on site, you must have written permission from Brisbane Makerspace to do so. A chemical is not allowed to be bought on site, even temporarily, without a relevant MSDS and written approval from Brisbane Makerspace.

If you bring a chemical on site, you are responsible for removing it from site, and safely/legally disposing of it.

### Pre-Approved Chemicals
The following chemicals present a low enough risk to be pre-approved. That means anything on this list is allowed to be bought on site and used, as long as you follow the relevant safety procedures.

When dealing with any chemical that is at risk of being splashed or spilled, at a minimum, you must wear gloves and safety glasses. The MSDS is linked below for each pre-approved chemical.

* [Acetone](/msds/diggers_acetone.pdf)
* [Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) - any strength](/msds/sydney_solvents_ipa_sds.pdf)
* [Methylated Spirits](/msds/diggers_methylated_spirits.pdf)
* Casting resins (for woodwork, art, etc.) - any specific brand must be inserted into the MSDS folder if it isn't already there.

### Other Chemicals in the MSDS
The following is a list of other chemicals (and similar substances) that are already in the MSDS and may be on site. The MSDS is linked below for each chemical.

* [PVA Glue](/msds/j_burrows_&_studymate_pva_glue_sds.pdf)
* [Nova3D 3D printer resin](/msds/405nm_resin.pdf)
* [eSUN ABS+ 3D printer filament](/msds/esun_abs_plus_filament.pdf)
* [eSUN PLA+ 3D printer filament](/msds/esun_pla_plus_filament.pdf)
