# Bad Behaviour
Everyone is human, and we try not to unreasonably penalise or reprimand people for genuine mistakes. However, patterns of mistakes, or more serious instances of bad behaviour need to be dealt with appropriately. Our Bad Behaviour policy is how we do that.

# Infractions
The way we identify bad behaviour is with an *Infraction*. An Infraction is our way of identifying that you breached one of our policies or expectations, and recording that breach for future reference. By default, there is no penalty attached to an Infraction. Members are encouraged to report all Infractions to the Infraction Committee, no matter how small. The Infraction Committee decides if an Infraction should be issued based on the evidence presented to them, or that they discover.

# Penalties
If an Infraction is serious enough to warrant some form of penalty, or a pattern of bad behaviour is identified, an Infraction may be accompanied with a penalty. Primarily, a penalty will be an Access Suspension, but may be another form of "making good" such as cleaning up a mess or paying for a tool that was damaged.

A penalty must never take the form of a fine or monetary penalty unless there was a direct cost to BMS such as a broken tool due to negligence. In this case, any monetary penalty must not be greater than the actual cost incurred by BMS. Fines are not an equitable penalty in most cases.

# Access Suspension
A penalty may come in the form of an Access Suspension. This does not change your membership status - you are still a member and entitled to vote in meetings. However, during the Access Suspension period, you are not permittd to:
* Come on site without written permission from the executive committee. It is up to the executive committee to decide if it is reasonable for you to come on site (for example, to collect personal belongings).
* Use any BMS Inc. resource or facility other than our Discord and Forum.

During an access suspension, you are required to maintain your membership by paying your fees. If you do not wish to pay membership while you have an Access Suspension, you can cancel your membership.

# Issuing an Infraction
For an Infraction to be official, it must be issued by the Infraction Committee, or by a vote at a general meeting. An infraction or penalty may be appealed at a general meeting by a simple majority vote.

Any member can report an Infraction to the Infraction Committee for investigation. If the Infraction Committee finds evidence that a breach of policy or group expectations occured, they are obligated to issue an Infraction. If they choose not to issue an Infraction, it can be refered to a general meeting for consideration. The Infraction Committee can issue an Infraction by a simple majority vote.

All Infractions must be posted on the forum under the Infractions category and remain visible to members at all time, but may be hidden from the general public. The post must be published within 48 hours of the Infraction being issued, and preferably after the person has been notified (or at the same time, but never before). The forum post must contain the following information:
* The date(s) and time(s) the bad behaviour occured on.
* What evidence was used to make this decision (e.g. a screenshot from a CCTV camera or access log).
* How the member can avoid a similar Infraction in the future.
* The penalty associated with the Infraction (if any) and specific details like the length and start date of an Access Suspension.

# Infraction Schedule
The Infraction Schedule below contains a list of Infractions that the Infraction Committee is *obligated* to issue. Each Infraction is accompanied with a suggested penalty, but the actual penalty issued may be slightly different depending on the situation.

## Escalation
Each time an additional Infraction is issued in a category, the penalty should become more severe. Each category outlines the expected escalation of a penalty and should be treated separately from each other.

Once a member has been issued with the maximum number of Infractions in any category, they are required to show cause as to why their membership shouldn't be cancelled. This is 4x offences for Category 1, 3x for Category 2, and 2x for Category 3. It is expected that the executive committee would handle a situation like this and cancel someone's membership if they could not show adequate cause.

## Category 1
These Infractions are minor, and first offences **should not** be accompanied by an Access Suspension penalty. However, after the first offence, each additional offence should be accompanied by an Access Suspension going from 1 week, 2 weeks, then up to 4 weeks.

* Not cleaning up after yourself (e.g. leaving a mess and not tidying the area that you used).
* Not locking up or securing the site properly.
* Not reporting a safety or maintenance issue that you discovered.
* Leaving a battery charging unatended.
* Causing minor (repairable) damage to a tool due to accidental misuse or negligence.
* Causing BMS Inc. to breach any condition of our lease not already defined in a category.
* Breaching a policy enacted by a team.
* Any other *minor* breach of a policy not already defined in a category.
* Doing something that needs to be added to this Category.

## Category 2
These Infractions are more severe than Category 1, and first offences **should** be accompanied by an Access Suspension penalty. Each offence should be accompanied by an Access Suspension going from 2 weeks, 4 weeks, then up to 2 months.

* Not reporting a safety or maintenance issue that you caused or contributed to (e.g. you broke a tool and didn't report it). This includes making and leaving dangerous items like exposed extension cords, etc.
* Causing a significant nuisance to BMS Inc. such as engaging in Unreasonable Complainant Conduct as defined by the Federal Ombudsman.
* Using a tool contrary to it's official process or without meeting all of it's induction requirements.
* Intentionally using a tool in an unsafe manner, or a manner which is likely to damage it.
* Leaving a tool running and leaving the immediate area (with the exception of tools allowed to be left unatended like some 3D printers).
* Modifying a tool, including permorming maintenance, without the consent of the team managing it (except for things permitted as per it's wiki page).
* Allowing another person (whether or not they are member) to use facilities they are not entitled to such as swiping on a tool for them, or allowing them on site without an access card.
* Performing unlicense electrical work or working on high voltage projects (including fractal burning) that are illegal under QLD state law.
* Accessing BMS Inc. facilities during an Access Suspension due to overdue fees or without being a member (other than during public events or public facilities like Discord).
* Any other *major* breach of a policy not already defined in a category.
* Doing something that needs to be added to this Category.

## Category 3
These Infractions are major, and first offences **should be treated seriously**. Every offence should be accompanied by an Access Suspension going from 1 month, then 3 months.

* Anything illegal, including, but not limited to:
	* Physical or verbal assault of another person.
  * Using or being under the influence of illicit substances.
  * Serious harrasment or threatening another person.
* Access BMS Inc. facilities during an Access Suspension due to an Infraction penalty.
* Not completing a required action as part of an Infraction penalty (e.g., not cleaning up a mess you were required to, etc.).
* Attempting (whether you are successful or not) to cover up, hide, or seriously misrepresent an incident.
* Using a tool in a way that is likely to cause serious personal injury or death (e.g. using a lathe with the chuck key installed, or removing a safety guide/barrier from a tool in an unreasonable situation).
* Defeating a safety interlock or access system in order to use a tool or resource you are not entitled to.
* Damaging any of our tools or resources to the extent that they require complete replacement due to intentional misuse or unreasonable negligence.
* Doing something that needs to be added to this Category.
