# Introduction
Brisbane Makerspace aims to foster an inclusive and friendly culture for all members. Our Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for community behaviour which are important to keep in mind.

If you see any behaviour contrary to our Code of Conduct, you are encouraged to politely remind those involved that it's not appropriate. In addition, you should report any incidents to staff.

## Respect
It is important to treat everyone with respect and consideration at all times. This includes being respectful to staff, other members, guests, and our facilities. Always be considerate in how you treat others.

## Discrimination and Inclusivity
Brisbane Makerspace is a safe space for everyone. Any sort of discrimination, marginalisation, or similar, based on a protected personal characteristic, is strictly prohibited. Things like **sexism, racism, ableism, religious or political persecution, homophobic or transphobic behaviour** (non exhaustive list) **is not tolerated at any time**. Any other behavior not listed above that would make a reasonable person feel marginalised or discriminated against is also not tolerated.

An important part of our Code of Conduct is respecting and using a person's correct gender pronouns and name. Mistakes happen, but repeated mis-gendering or mis-naming someone will not be tolerated. 

More often than not, the world is unfortunately not an equal or equitable place. We're doing our part to improve this, so if you have any suggestions on making Brisbane Makerspace more accessible or inclusive, please let our staff know.

## Abuse and Violence
Abuse and violence of any kind are strictly prohibited. This includes verbal/physical assault, harassment, or intimidation. We have a zero tolerance policy for abuse and violence. Your membership will be immediately and permanently terminated if you are found to have demonstrated abusive or violent behaviour.

## Honesty
Honesty is an important aspect of any community. Brisbane Makerspace will always be honest and upfront with our members and community, and we expect the same in return. We know that sometimes not everything goes to plan, and accidents do happen. However, it's always better to be upfront about something, even if it means admitting you did something wrong.

Being honest is always the right thing to do, and any sort of dishonesty (including manipulation, lying by omission, etc.) goes against this code of conduct. If you leave a mess, break a tool, or do something wrong, please let us know before we find out and you'll always be better off.

## Nuisance Behaviour
Any other behaviour or action not described in this Code of Conduct, but would be considered by a reasonable person to cause a nuisance (such as being too loud, leaving a mess, etc.) is prohibited.
