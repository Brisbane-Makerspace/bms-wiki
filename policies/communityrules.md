# Community Rules
If a rule or policy isn't big enough to get a page on our [list of policies](/policies), you'll find it here.

## Refund/Cancellation Policy
This refund policy does not override or exclude your rights under Australian Consumer Law (ACL). If goods and services you purchase from Brisbane Makerspace are faulty or not fit for purpose, you may be entitled to a refund under ACL.

If you wish to cancel your membership, you can do so from our member portal [here](https://portal.brisbanemaker.space). You can cancel at any time after your minimum membership period has lapsed (this may differ depending on your plan). Your membership will be automatically terminated at the end of your current billing cycle after you request cancellation. We do not give refunds for unused membership part way through a billing cycle.

Materials and tool usage charges are not refundable outside of exceptional circumstances or where required under ACL. Memberbucks top-ups or complimentary credits are final and cannot be refunded or converted to cash.

## Moderation
Sometimes certain discussions or posts may need to be removed or hidden, or other moderation actions taken in order to keep a discussion civil. All official communication platforms such as Discord, the Forum, the Wiki, Social Media accounts, etc. may be moderated.

## Tickets
### Green Storage Ticket
Green tickets are required to be attached to all items left on-site outside of your storage cube. They allow you to store something on site for up to 30 days at a time and must be renewed prior to expiry. Any item found with an expired green ticket, or no ticket, will be issued with a red ticket.

### Red Storage Ticket
Red tickets offer a formal warning that this item is not allowed to be here. Once a red ticket has been attached to an item, you have 7 days to rectify the problem. You must either attach a green ticket to it (if appropriate) or remove it off-site. A good faith effort must be made to find out and contact the owner of the item when a red ticket is attached to it.

Once a red ticket ticket has expired, Brisbane Makerspace may choose to dispose of the item or move it to long term storage.

### Orange Ticket
Typically we repair tools pretty quickly, but sometimes we need to wait on parts etc. If a tool can't be safely used, it will have an orange ticket attached to it. This will explain what's wrong with the tool and when it's expected to be fixed. Orange ticketed tools are **not to be used** until the orange ticket has been removed.

## Storage
Storage of personal items is not permitted anywhere on-site, except where permitted below.
### Member Storage Shelves
You are entitled to one cube in the member storage shelves for as long as you are a member. Feel free to claim any unlabeled spot and let the head maker know so a label can be added. You may not store any dangerous material or chemicals and everything must fit entirely within the cube without sticking out.

### Temporary Project Storage
We recognise that sometimes you may need to leave a project on-site while the paint is drying or glue is setting, etc. You are permitted to leave one project on top of the member storage shelves if it's too big to fit in your storage cube. **You must use a green storage ticket for temporary project storage.**

### Large Object Storage
You are entitled to store one large object, for up to 30 days at a time in the storage vault downstairs. If it doesn't fit in the storage vault because it is too big, or because of other projects, you must not store it on-site. Storage of additional large objects may be approved by a written request to the head maker. Examples of "large objects" include a group of laser cutter materials, a project you're working on, etc. **You must use a green storage ticket for large objects.**

### Dislaimer
Anything that is left on site unattended, is done so at your own risk. Brisbane Makerspace takes no responsibility for anything that may happen to items you leave on-site. Any items found to be in breach of this policy may be disposed of after 7 days of being in breach as per the red storage ticket policy.

## Guests
Outside of our publically advertised events, access is only available to paid up members and their guests.

If you're a member wanting to bring a guest along, you must follow these rules:
* No more than 2 people are allowed to accompany you as a guest.
* Guests are not allowed to use yellow or red tools.
* Guests under 18 are not allowed to use any tools.
* You and your guest(s) must be working on the same project - ie one project per membership.
* Guests may be asked to leave if Brisbane Makerspace is at capacity, or if they cause a nuisance.
* Guests are not permitted to work on commercial projects. All individuals working on commercial projects must have their own membership (but it's fine to bring a co-worker if they're just watching).

## COVID-19
Brisbane Makerspace requires all members to follow current public health orders and best practices at all times. This includes wearing masks and signing in if required by current guidelines. We recommend that all members regularly wash and sanitise their hands, and stay socially distant from other members where possible. If you refuse to follow a current public health order (such as checking in or wearing a mask), you will be refused entry or asked to leave, and issued with an infraction under our [Bad Behaviour Policy](/policies/bad-behaviour).
