# Community Rules
If a rule or policy isn't big enough to get a page on our [list of policies](/policies), you'll find it here.

## Refund/Cancellation Policy
This refund policy does not override or exclude your rights under Australian Consumer Law (ACL). If goods and services you purchase from Brisbane Makerspace are faulty or not fit for purpose, you may be entitled to a refund under ACL.

If you wish to cancel your membership, you can do so from our member portal [here](https://portal.brisbanemaker.space). You can cancel at any time after your minimum membership period has lapsed (this may differ depending on your plan). Your membership will be automatically terminated at the end of your current billing cycle after you request cancellation. We do not give refunds for unused membership part way through a billing cycle.

Materials and tool usage charges are not refundable outside of exceptional circumstances or where required under ACL. Memberbucks top-ups or complimentary credits are final and cannot be refunded or converted to cash.

## Moderation
Sometimes certain discussions or posts may need to be removed or hidden, or other moderation actions taken in order to keep a discussion civil. All official communication platforms such as Discord, the Forum, the Wiki, Social Media accounts, etc. may be moderated.

## Storage at Brisbane Makerspace
Due to the limited space available on-site, there is no general storage of personal belongings or member projects permitted. However, we recognise that sometimes you may need to leave a project on-site while the paint is drying or glue is setting, etc. Each member is entitled to leave one project on the designated temporary storage shelf for up to 7 days at a time. If there is not enough room on the temporary storage shelf, you will have to make arrangements to transport your project home and you may not leave it on site.

Anything that is left on site unattended, is done so at your own risk. If you choose to leave anything on-site under this policy, you must label it with your name and mobile number. Brisbane Makerspace takes no responsibility for anything that may happen to your belongings or personal projects.

Any personal belongings or member projects found to be in breach of this policy may be disposed of after 7 days of being in breach. However, a good faith effort to contact the owner must be made before belongings can be disposed of.

## Guests
Outside of our publically advertised events, access is only available to paid up members and their guests.

If you're a member wanting to bring a guest along, you must follow these rules:
* No more than 2 people are allowed to accompany you as a guest.
* Guests are not allowed to use yellow or red tools.
* Guests under 18 are not allowed to use any tools.
* You and your guest(s) must be working on the same project - ie one project per membership.
* Guests may be asked to leave if Brisbane Makerspace is at capacity, or if they cause a nuisance.
* Guests are not permitted to work on commercial projects. All individuals working on commercial projects must have their own membership (but it's fine to bring a co-worker if they're just watching).

## COVID-19
Brisbane Makerspace requires all members to follow current public health orders and best practices at all times. This includes wearing masks and signing in if required by current guidelines. We recommend that all members regularly wash and sanitise their hands, and stay socially distant from other members where possible. If you refuse to follow a current public health order (such as checking in or wearing a mask), you will be refused entry or asked to leave, and issued with an infraction under our [Bad Behaviour Policy](/policies/bad-behaviour).
