# Introduction
We try to foster a fun and collaborative environment at Brisbane Makerspace. To assist us, we have a list of community rules that everyone is required to follow. If you are using any of our facilities (on site tools, attending a workshop, or using our online platforms) these rules apply to you, regardless of if you're a member.

## Policies
We have a list of policies available on our wiki at https://wiki.brisbanemaker.space/policies. As a member or guest using our facilities, you are required to follow **all** of our policies at **all times**. Our policies (including our community rules) may change at any time. Significant changes will be anounced to members.

## Code of Conduct
Our [code of conduct](/policies/codeofconduct) is part of our policies page, but it deserves a special mention. We do not tolerate any sort of discrimination, anti-social behaviour, violence or "problem makers". If you breach our Code of Conduct, there's a very good chance that your membership will be immediately, and permanently, terminated. Please be respectful of everyone around you.

## Commercial Use
Brisbane Makerspace is focused on providing an amazing workshop and learning environment for *individuals*. Commercial prototyping is acceptable, but using our facilities to manufacture goods is not. If you're using our facilities to generate a large part of your business or personal income, please reconsider if you're doing the right thing. Commercially focused manufacturing facilities are significantly more expensive (and more suitable) for a reason.

We encourage (and in fact love to see!) commissioned projects. Just make sure you're not using our facilities as a full time manufacturing workshop. If you're using our facilities significantly more than a typical individual member, you may be asked to pay more or reduce your usage.

## Membership Eligibility and Termination
We strive to be an accepting and inclusive place for all members of society who are interested in making amazing projects. As such, generally membership is eligible to everyone. However, we reserve the right to refuse membership to any person for any reason if we think they may cause problems in our community.

Sometimes, after becoming a member, someone causes unnecessary stress to our staff, or is generally causing a nuisance in our community. As such, Brisbane Makerspace reserves the right to terminate your membership for any reason. If this happens, you'll be notified and will be provided a refund for unused membership.

## Membership Fees
To maintain membership, you are required to pay your membership fees by the due date of your billing period. Failure to do so may result in suspension of your access to our facilities until payment is made. If you fall too far into arrears, we may terminate your membership entirely. If you have any problems paying for your membership please let us know, we're here to help!

In addition, we offer discounted rates to try and enable more equitable access to our community. To be eligible for our discounted rates, you must prove that you're a current full time student or concession card holder. If you cease meeting these requirements, please notify us as soon as possible so we can update your membership rates. If you don't notify us, and we later find out, we reserve the right to collect the difference of any unpaid fees.

## Consumables
As a member, you are allowed to use any consumable we have on site (for example, glue, popsicle sticks, pens, etc.). All consumables, unless otherwise noted, are free to use. However, a fair use policy applies.

If you are close to breaching the fair use policy, we will try to provide a warning. If you breach our fair use policy, we reserve the right to charge you for excessive use (including the cost of excessive consumables and a restocking fee).

### Fair use of consumables
* Consumables are only to be used for personal projects or occasional commisions.
* Excessive or unreasonable amounts of consumable use are prohibited (for example, using up an entire bag of pom poms for your project).
* Commerical use of consumables is prohibited. Occasional use in commisioned projects is fine, but regular commercial use is not. Our consumables are here for member convenience, not as a cheap source for your business.

## Storage at Brisbane Makerspace
Some membership plans may include a small designated storage tub, and this policy does not apply to that tub. 

Due to the limited space available on site, there is no general storage of personal belongings or member projects permitted. However, we recognise that sometimes you may need to leave a project on site while paint is drying or glue is setting, etc. Each member is entitled to leave one project on the designated temporary storage shelf for up to 3 days at a time. If there is not enough room on the temporary storage shelf, you will have to make arrangements to transport your project home and you may not leave it on site.

If you need to leave for a short while, and will return within 2 hours, you may leave personal belongings or projects on site outside of the temporary storage shelf. However, if you do, you must ensure they are left in a safe and tidy condition, and not cluttering up a workspace.

Anything that is left on site unattended, is done so at your own risk. If you choose to leave anything on site in accordance with this policy, you must label it with your name and mobile number. Brisbane Makerspace takes no reponsibility for anything that may happen to your belongings or personal projects.

Any personal belongings or member projects found to be in breach of this policy may be disposed of without warning, so please make sure you understand this policy.

## Site Sign In
All members are required to use the member app, or member portal website to sign in when they arrive on site, and sign out when they leave site. The Brisbane Makerspace access system will prevent you from accessing our facilities unless you are signed in.

This is to help us ensure we have a list of people who may be on site in the event of an emergency, and to assist us in complying with any occupancy limits that may be in place. To avoid any doubt, this sign in requirement is in addition to checking in with the QLD government contact tracing app.

## Guests
We welcome walk in guests during our staffed hours. During this time, we're happy to give you a tour, explain how we work and answer any questions. Outside of this time, access is to paid up members and their guests only.

If you're a member wanting to bring a guest along, you must follow these rules:
* No more than 2 people are allowed to accompany you as a guest.
* Guests are not allowed to use orange or red tools.
* Guests under 12 are not allowed to use any tools (including scissors etc).
* You and your guest(s) must be working on the same project.
* Guests may be asked to leave if Brisbane Makerspace is at capacity, or they cause a nuisance.
* Guests are not permitted to work on commercial projects and all individuals doing so must have their own membership (but it's fine to bring a co-worker if they're just watching for example).
* All guests must use the QLD government check in app, and must complete an indemnity waiver prior to using any tools (available at the check in desk). You are responsible for ensuring this happens.

## COVID-19
Brisbane Makerspace requires all members to follow current public health orders and best practices at all times. This includes wearing masks and signing in with the QLD check in app if necessary. We recommend that all members regularly wash and sanitise their hands, and stay socially distant to other members where possible. If you refuse to follow a current public health order (such as checking in or wearing a mask), you will be refused entry and asked to leave.

### Vaccinations
From December 1st 2021, Brisbane Makerspace will require all members and guests to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with a recognised or approved vaccine. When you collect your membership card or come on site as a guest, you will be asked to provide proof of vaccination status or a medical exemption. If you cannot provide either, your memhership will be suspended and you will be asked to leave until you can.
