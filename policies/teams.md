# Summary
**For a list of current / past teams, please see [this page](/teams).**

Teams are how BMS Inc. manages its limited volunteer resources. Teams are designed to be as lightweight as possible and give each team the freedom to decide what they want to achieve and how they should operate. This is a *very* difficult problem to tackle, and it's important to read the historical footnotes to understand why we run this way.

## Team requirements
The minimum requirements to run a team are as follows:
* a team name
* at least two team members
* a team leader (as elected by the team from time to time)
* an operations page on the wiki that contains:
	* the goal of the team
  * the area they want to look after (physical, digital, or other)
  * what policies govern their team area
  * what budgets do they have access to
  
To change any part of their team operations page requires a vote at a general meeting, or a majority vote by all current team members (except budget changes which must go through a general meeting).

A team leader does not have any special privileges other than approving purchases under a budget. However, it is expected that a team leader is the most involved member of the team and helps to set the direction and pace of the team.

## Joining/leaving an existing team
To join an existing team, you just need to ask the team - it's up to them if they want to take a formal vote or not. The team cannot unreasonably deny your request to join. However, a team reserves the right to reject your request if they have a good reason (such as you've caused problems in the past).

## Team Budgets
Any changes to a team budget must be approved by a vote at a general meeting before a team can spend it. A team budget can be a once-off, ongoing, or another type of budget.

All purchases made under a team budget must:
* be approved by the team leader in writing (discord or email is fine)
* have an itemised tax invoice or receipt that is sent to the Treasurer for record-keeping purposes

## How to start a team
Create an operations page on our wiki [here](/teams/), then bring it to a vote at a general meeting. If it's approved, you now have a new team! Once it's been approved, don't forget to add it to the list of current teams.

# Historical footnotes
Most makerspaces around the world end up creating some sort of "group" or "sub-committee" structure to help them manage their space and volunteer resources. Due to the chaotic nature of community-run makerspaces, it's critical to have some sort of structure.

However, because everyone is a volunteer, it's important not to impose unreasonable requirements and red tape which take the fun out of volunteering. We hope that by taking a middle ground we can provide enough structure to get things done efficiently while respecting the time and effort of our volunteers.
