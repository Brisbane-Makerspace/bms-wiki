# Summary
Teams are how BMS Inc. manages its limited volunteer resources. Teams are designed to be as lightweight as possible and give each team the freedom to decide what they want to achieve and how they should operate. This is a *very* difficult problem to tackle, and it's important to read the historical footnotes to understand why we run this way.

## Team requirements
The minimum requirements to run a team is as follows:
* a team name
* at least two team members
* a team leader (as elected by the team from time to time)
* an operations page on the wiki that contains:
	* the goal of the team
  * the area they want to look after (physical, digital, or other)
  * what policies govern their team area
  * what budgets they have access to
  
To change any part of their team operations page requires a vote at a general meeting, or a majority vote by all current team members.

A team leader does not have any special privileges other than approving purchases under a budget. However, it is expected that a team leader is the most involved member of the team and help sets the direction and pace of the team.

## Joining / leaving an existing team
To join an existing team, you just need to ask the team - it's up to them if they want to take a formal vote or not. The team cannot unreasonably deny your request to join. However, a team reserves the right to reject your request to join a team if they have a good reason (such as you've caused problems in the past).

## Team Budgets
Any changes to a team budget must be approved by a vote at a general meeting before a team can spend it. 

All purchases made under a team budget must:
* be approved by the team leader in writing (discord or email is fine)
* have an itemised tax invoice or receipt
* have a tax invoice or receipt that is sent to the treasurer for record keeping purposes

## How to start a team
Create an operations page on our wiki [here](/teams/), then bring it to a vote at a general meeting. If it's approved, you now have a new team! Once it's been approved, don't forget to add it to the list of current teams.

# Historical footnotes
Most makerspaces around the world end up creating some sort of "group" or "sub-committee" structure to help them manage their space and volunteer resources. Due to the chaotic nature of community-run makerspaces, it's critical to have some sort of structure. However, because everyone is a volunteer, it's important not to impose unreasonable requirements and red tape which take the fun out of volunteering.

[HSBNE Inc.](https://hsbne.org) is one of Australia's largest hackerspaces, and has gone through several iterations of what they now call "teams". A lot of this policy is based on what our community has learnt from them, and we recognise the valuable insight their experience has given us. Several BMS members went through both systems first hand, so ask around for even more context.

Originally, HSBNE "causes" existed which were funded based on how many members they had. This caused a lot of internal conflict between the different causes/cliques which was detrimental to the long term stability of the space. It also meant that getting funding to grow or even just maintain the smaller "causes" became increasingly difficult. "Causes" could also vote on what they spent money on, and what policies they wanted to enforce in their areas (such as what tools need inductions, etc).

Eventually, "causes" were replaced with "teams" in an attempt to fix some of these issues. Whilst "teams" were a step in the right direction, that structure bought new problems with it. The entire model changed so that teams were more general and could cover things like infrastructure as well as physical workspaces. However, the additional red tape, reporting and bureaucracy, and "volunteer contract" requirements made it hard to find people who were willing to join a team. Several people who use to run a "cause" either never created a "team" or resigned not long after forming one. This is because the additional overheads and red tape removed all the "fun" from volunteering and required that they make unreasonable commitments.

The system of "teams" in use at BMS Inc. aims to strike a balance between the division created through the inequitable funding and popularity contest of HSBNE "causes", and the onerous requirements imposed by their latest "teams" structure. We hope that by taking a middle ground we can provide enough structure to get things done efficiently while respecting the time and effort of our volunteers.
