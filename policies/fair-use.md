# Fair Use Policy
Brisbane Makerspace is focused on providing an amazing workshop and learning environment for everyone. Commercial prototyping and small volume manufacturing are perfectly acceptable, provided it doesn't impact other members unfairly.

You must stay within reasonable limits and not unfairly impact other members with excessive use. For example, laser cutting projects a few times over the space of a week is fine. However, using the laser cutter every day for an extended period of time is not.

Some membership plans may have limits on visits or tool use. These are "soft limits" and will generally only be enforced if you're in breach of this fair use policy and causing problems. For the purpose of this policy, several visits on the same day count as 1 visit. Your swipe card won't stop working if you hit a limit, we'll reach out to start a discussion if you do.

If anything is still unclear, just [let us know](https://brisbanemaker.space/contact) and we're happy to clarify what is or is not reasonable use under your specific membership plan.

## Mentoring and Assistance
Mentoring and assistance is provided on a best-effort basis by staff and other members. It is meant to help you get started and is not a replacement for seeking professional advice or putting in the effort to learn a new skill.

One 30min mentoring session is included each month as part of your membership and can be booked from the member portal ("Book an Appointment"). Each tool that requires a safety induction also includes complimentary mentoring as part of your safety induction. Additional sessions are available on request and are charged at $60/hr (or as otherwise agreed).

Brisbane Makerspace makes no guarantees as to the availability or quality of mentoring or advice that is provided. By accepting any mentoring or advice, you acknowledge this and agree to release Brisbane Makerspace and it's members from all liability associated with any loss or inury that occurs as a result of mentoring/advice provided.

## Tool Sharing
Occasionally more than one person may want to use a tool at the same time. This is part of using a shared workshop. Members are expected to fairly share tools between people who want to use them.

Tool inductions and workshops should take priority over general member use. These normally won't take more than 30-60 minutes and are an important part of welcoming members into our community.

There are also some specific guidelines below. This is how we expect members to operate out of respect for each other.


#### Opt-in Booking System
Some tools can be booked **once per day for up to 2 hours**. To book, access the link in the member portal. You can also use most tools without a booking - see casual use below.

**During a booking, use by other members is not permitted without permission from the booking holder.** If someone is using the tool when a booking starts, they should cease use as soon as possible and at most within 15 minutes after the start of the booking. **Please be kind**, if someone is nearly done a very long job, then let them finish it.

The following tools use the opt-in booking system:
* [Laser Cutter](/tools/digifab/lasercutter)
* [CNC Router](/tools/digifab/cncrouter)

#### Casual Use
Using any tool without a booking is considered casual use. If someone is using, or expected to use a tool for a long time, and another member wants to briefly use it, that member should be given priority.

Otherwise, if more than 1 person is waiting to use a tool, members are expected to take turns in **no more than** 1 hour blocks.

## Consumables
As a member, you are allowed to use any consumables we have on-site (for example, glue, solder, pens, tape, etc.). All consumables, unless otherwise noted, are free to use. However, our Consumable Fair Use Policy below applies. If you breach this policy, we reserve the right to charge you for the cost of the excessive consumables used.

### Fair use of consumables
* Consumables are only to be used in projects whilst onsite and "spare" consumables may not be taken offsite.
* Excessive or unreasonable amounts of consumable use are prohibited.
  * For example, using up an entire bag of pom-poms for your project - please buy a bag if you need that many.
* Commercial use of consumables is generally discouraged. If you find you are using some of our consumables regularly (ie shipping labels to pack orders, pipe cleaners as part of your manufacturing process) please bring your own.
