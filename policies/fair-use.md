# Fair Use Policy
Brisbane Makerspace is focused on providing an amazing workshop and learning environment. Commercial prototyping and small volume manufacturing are acceptable, provided it doesn't impact other members unfairly.

You must stay within reasonable limits and not unfairly impact other members with excessive use. For example, laser cutting projects a few times over the space of a week is fine. However, using the laser cutter every day of the week is not.

Maker Lite and Maker Plus plans are limited to an average of 2 visits per week (averaged over the last month). For the purpose of this policy, several visits on the same day count as 1 visit.

If you're unsure, just [let us know](https://brisbanemaker.space/contact) and we're happy to clarify what is or is not reasonable use. If you're using our facilities more than what's reasonable, you may be asked to pay more or reduce your usage.

## Mentoring and Assistance
Mentoring and assistance is provided on a best-effort basis. It is meant to help you get started and is not a replacement for seeking professional advice or putting in the effort to learn a new skill.

One 30min mentoring session is included each month as part of your membership and can be booked from the member portal ("Book an Appointment"). Each tool that requires a safety induction also includes complimentary mentoring for up to 30mins following your safety induction. Additional sessions are available on request and are charged at $50/hr (or as otherwise agreed).

Brisbane Makerspace makes no guarantees as to the availability or quality of mentoring and assistance that is provided. By accepting any mentoring or advice, you acknowledge this and agree to release Brisbane Makerspace from all liability associated with any loss or inury that occurs as a result of mentoring/advice provided.

## Tool Sharing
Occasionally more than one person may want to use a tool at the same time. This is part of using a shared workshop. Members are expected to fairly share tools between people who want to use them.

Tool inductions and workshops should take priority over general member use. These normally won't take more than 30-60 minutes and are an important part of welcoming members into our community.

There are also some tool specific guidelines below. This is how we expect members to operate out of respect for each other.

### Lasercutting
#### Bookings
You can book the laser cutter **once per day for up to 2 hours**, and requires at least 2 hours of notice. To book, access the link in the member portal. You can use it longer than this or without making a booking if there are no other bookings at the time. See casual use below.

**During a booking, use by other members is not permitted.** If a member is using the machine when a booking starts, they should cease use as soon as possible and at most within 15 minutes after the start of the booking.

#### Casual Use
Use without a booking is considered casual use. If someone is using the machine, and another member wants to run a small (<15 minute) job, that member should be given priority.

Otherwise, if more than 1 person is waiting to use the laser cutter, members are expected to take turns in 1 hour blocks.

## Consumables
As a member, you are allowed to use any consumables we have on-site (for example, glue, popsicle sticks, pens, etc.). All consumables, unless otherwise noted, are free to use. However, our Consumable Fair Use Policy below applies. If you breach this policy, we reserve the right to charge you for the cost of the excessive consumables used.

### Fair use of consumables
* Consumables are only to be used in projects whilst on site and "spare" consumables may not be taken offsite.
* Excessive or unreasonable amounts of consumable use are prohibited (for example, using up an entire bag of pom-poms for your project).
* Commercial use of consumables is generally discouraged. Use in commissioned projects that are not part of your main business is fine, but regular commercial use is not.
