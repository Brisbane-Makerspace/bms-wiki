# Fair Use Policy
Brisbane Makerspace is focused on providing an amazing workshop and learning environment for *individuals*. Commercial prototyping and occasional commercial use are perfectly acceptable, as long as it doesn't impact other members.

You must stay within reasonable limits and not unfairly impact other members with excessive use. For example, laser cutting (commercial or personal) projects a few times over the space of a week is fine. However, using the laser cutter every day of the week regularly is not. There is no hard and fast rule, but we consider a reasonable amount of use to be around 5 hours per week of laser cutting, or 15 hours per week of 3D printing.

If you're unsure, just [let us know](https://brisbanemaker.space/contact) and we're happy to clarify what is or is not reasonable use. If you're using our facilities significantly more than a typical member, you may be asked to pay more or reduce your usage.

## Consumables
As a member, you are allowed to use any consumables we have on-site (for example, glue, popsicle sticks, pens, etc.). All consumables, unless otherwise noted, are free to use. However, our Consumable Fair Use Policy (below) applies. If you breach our fair use policy, we reserve the right to charge you for excessive use (including the cost of the excessive consumables used).

### Fair use of consumables
* Consumables are only to be used in projects whilst on site and "spare" consumables may not be taken offsite.
* Excessive or unreasonable amounts of consumable use are prohibited (for example, using up an entire bag of pom-poms for your project).
* Commercial use of consumables is generally discouraged. Use in commissioned projects that are not part of your main business is fine, but regular commercial use is not.
