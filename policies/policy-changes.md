# Policy Changes
The point of a policy is for people to follow it, so it's critical we make that easy to do.

## Policy Principles
* Policy should be as short and concise as possible; start with the minimum and add over time.
* Policy should use simple language and be easy to understand; no "legaleese" or overcomplicated phrasing.
* Policy should be seen as a last resort and changing processes or using engineering controls should be attempted first. In other words, instead of a "no dumping rubbish at the door" policy, try putting a bin there first.

## Process For New Policy or Significant Changes
1. A proposal is put forward at a general meeting for a new policy, or for significant changes to an existing policy.
2. The membership must decide whether the new policy or significant change is needed, and what goal they want to achieve from it (e.g. a "no dumping rubbish" policy may have a goal of "stop people from dumping rubbish at the door").
3. If the membership decides the policy is needed, it should be refered to the policy team for evaluation. They should investigate if an engineering control may be more appropriate, or write a draft.
4. Once the policy team has written a draft policy or suggested an engineering control, it should be circulated on the forum for feedback.
5. Once a general consesus has been reached, the *exact wording* of the policy must be put into a pull request on GitHub [here](https://github.com/brisbanemakerspace/bms-wiki/tree/main/policies), and an agenda item to adopt it must be raised at a general meeting.
6. If the policy is adopted at the meeting, the pull request must be merged as soon as possible. For constitution changes, the pull request must not be merged until it has been approved by the Office of Fair Trading.

## Process For Minor Changes
1. For minor changes to an existing policy, the *exact wording* of the change must be put into a pull request on GitHub [here](https://github.com/brisbanemakerspace/bms-wiki/tree/main/policies), and an agenda item to adopt it must be raised at a general meeting.
2. Minor change suggestions can come directly from members, but they are encouraged to consult with the policy team.

## Constitution Changes
These are a little bit special, but should follow the new policy process above. They must be approved at a *special general meeting*, and must be submitted to the Office of Fair Trading for approval before they can be adopted. Check [the constitution](/policies/constitution) for details on what a *special general meeting* is.
