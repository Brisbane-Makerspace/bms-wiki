# Introduction
We try to foster a fun, safe and collaborative environment at Brisbane Makerspace. To assist us, we have a list of policies and rules that everyone is required to follow. If you are using our physical space, attending a workshop, or using our discord/forum, these rules apply to you.

Our policies may change at any time by a vote at a general meeting. Significant changes will be anounced to members via email.
