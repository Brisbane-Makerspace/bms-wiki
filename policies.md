# Introduction
We try to foster a fun, safe and collaborative environment at Brisbane Makerspace. To assist us, we have a list of policies and rules that everyone is required to follow. If you are using our physical space, attending a workshop, or using our digital resources, these rules apply to you.

Our policies may change at any time. Significant changes will be anounced to members via email.

The overarching theme to our policies can be summarised as:
* be respectful
* be reasonable
* be honest
