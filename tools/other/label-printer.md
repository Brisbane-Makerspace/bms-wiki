# Introduction
For small and occasional print jobs, you can use our direct thermal printer. **If you print more than 10 labels per week, please bring your own label rolls.** We may monitor and log print jobs to ensure that no one is abusing the printers.

This printer has USB or Bluetooth capabilities. You should generally use USB from a Mac or Windows computer.

It is critical that you both install **AND CONFIGURE** the print driver. If you do not configure the print driver, it will not print labels properly.
