# Introduction
You are welcome to use our printer for printing small amounts of documents, photos, etc. related to the project you're working on. We monitor and log print jobs to ensure that no one is abusing the printer.

# How to use
On Apple devices (including macOS, iOS and iPadOS) simply select "Brisbane Makerspace Printer" from the list of available printers. If you want to print from your iPhone or iPad, you can normally click "share" and then select print instead of sharing to another app.

On Android and Windows computers, you may have to manually add our printer if it doesn't automatically show up. It should be available on the network as "BrisbaneMakerspacePrinter" This process differs depending on your device and operating system.

# Troubleshooting
If you are having trouble printing, first check that you're connected to our WiFi or try restarting your device. If you're still having trouble, pop in during staffed hours and we can get you setup.
