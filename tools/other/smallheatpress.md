# Operating Checklist

## Before Use

1. Make sure to place the heat press on the protective base.
2. Plug in the unit to power.
3. Hold the power button on the front for 3 seconds to turn on.
4. Set the temperature to what best suits your material by pressing the button. (Full heat takes ~60 seconds).
5. Wait until the light turns green.

## During Use

1. Place the heat press to the side of the decal or vinyl you're looking to stick down to fabric and work your way across in a circular motion like you're ironing a piece of clothing.
2. For spots where it is still peeling up you can hold the hot section on it for a few seconds at a time.

## After Use

1. Place the hot plate back into the safety base and unplug.
2. Check in on it in 5 minutes to make sure it has cooled down.
