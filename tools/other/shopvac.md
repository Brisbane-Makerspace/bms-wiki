# Introduction
Our Ryobi & Ozito shopvacs are great for cleaning up after those messy projects.

# Specifications
**Induction Class:** ðŸŸ¢ Green Tool (No Induction Required)
**Storage Volume:** 20L (Ryobi) 15L (Ozito)

The Ozito lives upstairs for cleaning up laser cutter and 3D printer mess, and the Ryobi lives downstairs in the basement.

# How to use
Unwind the cord fully, then plug in and switch on. Use just like a normal vacuum cleaner! However, this shopvac can happily suck up "wet" things and liquids, unlike a normal vacuum. Please wind up the cord and return to it's home after use.
