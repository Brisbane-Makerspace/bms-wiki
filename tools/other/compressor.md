# Introduction
Our Stanley "silenced" air compressor is used to run the air assist in our laser cutter, and our air powered nail/staple gun.

# Specifications
**Induction Class:** Green Tool (No Induction Required)
**Storage Tank:** 50L
**Power:** 2.75 HP
**Free Air Delivery:** 210L/min
**Max Pressure:** 145 PSI

# How to use
Simply connect your air tool to the compressor's output. Please do not disconnect the laser cutter airline as it's required for operation.

The air compressor should not be used for high air volume tools as it is not rated for that. Whilst it claims to be a "sileced" model, it's still quite noisy, so be respectful of other users of the space.
