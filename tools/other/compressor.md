# Introduction
Our Ryobi air compressor is used to run the air assist in our laser cutter, and our air powered nail/staple gun.

# Specifications
**Induction Class:** Green Tool (No Induction Required)
**Storage Tank:** 50L
**Power:** 2.0 HP

# How to use
Simply connect your air tool to the compressor's output. Please do not disconnect the laser cutter airline as it's required for operation.

The air compressor should not be used for high air volume tools as it is not rated for that. The air compressor sits inside of a sound baffling box which greatly reduces it's operating noise.
