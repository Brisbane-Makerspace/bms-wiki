To book an **optional** induction for this tool, please use the "book appointment" link from the [member portal](https://portal.brisbanemaker.space).

# How to use
Simply connect your air tool to the compressor's output. Please do not disconnect the laser cutter airline ***for any reason*** as it's required for operation.

The air compressor should not be used for high air volume tools as it is not rated for that. The air compressor is downstairs in the white "compressor box" outside the basement. If there are any issues with the compressor, please let us know as this box is locked and inaccessible to memners.
