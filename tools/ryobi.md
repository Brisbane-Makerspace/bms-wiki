# Specifications
**Induction Class:** Yellow Tool (Induction Required)
**Voltage:** 18v

# Induction Process
This induction has one part:

1. Complete the online component by visiting this link: https://comingsoon.example.com

# How to use
Grab a battery from the Ryobi charging station. Check that it has enough charge (aim for > 50%) and then insert it into the bottom of your tool until you hear a click.

All of our Ryobi cordless tools are low risk, and can be used without induction. However, if you've never used a specific tool before, or are unsure about anything, we recommend you ask staff for a quick run through on how to use it.

When you are finished, please return the battery back to the Ryobi charging station. Please put the battery back on charge so it's full when the next person needs it.

# Troubleshooting
If you are having trouble with a tool, first check that the battery has enough charge (> 50%). If you're still having trouble, pop in during staffed hours and we can help you out.
