To book an induction for this machine, please use the "book appointment" link from the [member portal](https://portal.brisbanemaker.space).

# Slicing Software
These printers require the use of the Flashprint slicing software. This software is very easy to use and allows connection to our printers via WiFi.

Flashprint is installed on our iMac ready to go (bring your model on a USB flash drive, send it via AirDrop, or login to google drive etc.). However, you can also install it on your own computer in order to get an estimate on printing time, or to send print jobs directly from your own laptop. Flashprint supports macOS, Windows and Linux.

## Before Use
1. Prepare your model by downloading or exporting it in `.stl` format.
2. Open the "FlashPrint" software on our iMac and import your model by clicking on "Load" and selecting your file.
3. Click on "Print" then select `ABS` or `PLA`, then select the "standard" print profile.
4. Click on "OK", then select "Send GCode" if you're happy with the print time.
5. Watch the printer until the first layer is finished, then you can go work on something else!

## During Use
1. Check on the printer once every 30 minutes at a minimum. If you wish to leave a print unattended, please send staff a message via Discord and confirm they are aware of your print before leaving.
2. Regularly check the object has not come off the build plate and it's still printing correctly.

## After Use
1. Wait for the print bed to cool down before removing it.
2. Gently flex the print bed to release your object. You may need to use a spatula to help it off.
3. Clean up all bits of loose filament / plastic from around the print area, and gently use side cutters to remove excess plastic from the print bed.

# Brisbane Makerspace Stocked Materials
We try to keep the following filaments in stock for members to use but check with staff ahead of time if you need something specific. Filament is included in the hourly machine cost. We recommend using these unless you have a special need, as they've been chosen to work well with our machines and have calibrated profiles. If you'd like to suggest other filaments to stock, please let us know.
