# Introduction
Our laser cutter is one of our most popular tools. It can be used to cut or engrave lots of common materials including timber, plastic, and paper, to name a few.

# Recommended Uses
You can cut out unique shapes from sheets of materials up to 8mm thick. Laser cutting is ideal for making mounting plates, custom enclosures and boxes, etc.

You can also engrave text, images and other shapes directly onto your projects. This allows you to create truly unique works of art, add a personal touch to your project, or make something as simple as a name badge or plaque.

# Specifications
**Usage Cost:** $10/hr
**Induction Class:** Orange Tool (Induction Required)
**Cut/Engrave Area:** 700 x 500mm Max
**Laser Power:** Up to 60w
**Max Cut Depth:** 8mm depending on material

## Air Filtration
The laser cutter is also fitted with a professional air filtration system called the "BeamAir". This ensures fumes and smells associated with laser cutting are minimised, and you don't need to put up with them during jobs. You can find out more about the BeamAir system here: https://flux3dp.com.au/pages/beam-air but it's fully automated and switches on/off automatically.

# How To Operate
You should be familiar with how to operate this tool after completing an induction. However, a quick reference guide is included below to assist you.

## Before Use
1. Check that your material is on the approved materials list.
2. Focus the machine by placing the focus block on your piece of material. 
3. Import your job into lightburn and place it on your material. Check the correct profile has been selected for your material.
4. Start the job and watch until it is finished.

## During Use
1. Watch the machine **at all times** while it is running.
2. Do not look away from the machine or leave the machine unattended. Doing so will result in immediate termination of your membership for breaching our [safety policy](/policies/safety).
3. Immediately press the red "e-stop" button if you think there is a problem with the machine. It's always better to spoil a $20 piece of acrylic than an expensive machine. If a fire does not subside after stopping the machine, immediately grab a **CO2** fire extinguisher *then* open the machine.

## After Use
1. Clean every horizontal surface with the provided cleaning wipes.
2. Dispose of all offcuts into the bin or offcut box and tidy up the area.
3. Swipe off, and turn off the machine.

# Offcuts and Scraps
We have an offcuts box right next to the laser cutter. You are welcome to use any offcuts or scrap pieces of material from this bin for free. You are encouraged to leave any offcuts from your projects in this bin. However, you should break off any thin pieces and you should check that it's larger than the offcut size checker.

# Approved Materials
Some materials are dangerous to cut or engrave and can damage the machine or even worse, release poisonous fumes. We operate a very strict list of approved materials. If you use a material not on this list (without prior approval from staff), we will likely terminate your membership for breaching our safety policy.

We recommend that most people use Acrylic or "Laser Safe" Plywood for the cleanest cuts and least hassle. 

## List of Approved Materials
* "Laser Safe" plywood such as [LaserPly from Plyco](https://plyco.com.au/collections/laserply)
* Bunnings Plywood (BC Grade, not marine grade)
* Bunnings MDF
* Acrylic
	* Some materials are similar in appearance to acrylic but are quite different. Some can release poisonous fumes or result in poor cuts. Any acrylic that is not sourced from us must have a receipt or manufacturer affixed label showing that it is acrylic.
* Cardboard
