# Introduction
Our 3D scanner allows you to create amazingly detailed 3D scans of small and medium sized objects (think USB flash drive up to a person for sizing!). Use it in handheld (portable) mode or mount it on the tripod for scanning small objects.

# Recommended Uses
The 3D Scanner is ideal for scanning objects about as small as a USB flash drive, all the way up to a human (we've verified this)! Depending on the size and shape of the object, you can get medium quality, to extremely high quality scanning results - often good enough to 3D print with little or no post processing.

## Software
[DOWNLOAD REVO SCAN](https://www.revopoint3d.com/download/)

You should download the latest version of **Revo Scan** for your Mac or PC at the link above. It's best to use the Mac or PC software rather than the Android or iOS app as you'll get higher quality scan results. You may also want to download **Revo Studio** to help you post process your 3D scans.

This software is also installed on the 3D printing iMac, but it may be easier to install it on your own laptop so it's more portable.

# Induction Process
ðŸŸ¢ **This tool does not require an induction to use.** However, please be careful as it's delicate and expensive! If you'd like some help operating this for the first time, feel free to book an appointment for an induction.

To book an **optional** induction for this machine, please use the "book appointment" link from the [member portal](https://portal.brisbanemaker.space).

# How To Operate
## Before Use
**Note:** you should install the Revo Scan software (link above) before continuing.

1. Plug the USB cable into your computer.
2. Open the Revo Scan software.
3. Follow the prompts to begin a scan.

## During Use
1. Move SLOWLY. The most common issue with failed or poor quality scans is that you are moving too quickly!
2. If the tracking drops out and it stops scanning, move extra slowly back to where it was last tracking successfully and the software should automatically continue.
3. Do not touch the front of the scanner, and do not leave it anywhere but inside it's case when it's not in use.

## After Use
1. Carefully unplug the scanner from the computer and remove the cable.
2. Neatly wrap the cable up (but not too tight!) and place both the scanner and cable back inside the carry case.
3. Put the case back into it's spot.

# Post Processing
Sometimes a scan may have artefacts, blotches or missing details. This is typical of 3D scanning equipment, and especially so with consumer grade equipment. Commercial 3D scanners typically cost more than $10,000 for comparison! As a result, you may have to post process your scan using Revo Studio or the free Autodesk MeshMixer. You can use these software tools to remove artefacts and tidy up your scans.
