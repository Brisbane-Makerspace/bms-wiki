## Software
We use CarveCo and have a license for CarveCo Maker installed on the CNC Computer. This computer is setup just for running this CNC machine, and generally shouldn't be used for other purposes.

This software is called "CAM" software and is not capable of designing models - you need to use CAD software like Tinkercad or Fusion 360. CAM software is very difficult and complex to use. Prior to organising an induction your should at minimum, watch ALL of these videos.
