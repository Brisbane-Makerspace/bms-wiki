# Opt-in Booking System
Please use the link in the [member portal](https://portal.brisbanemaker.space) to see existing bookings or to make a new one. We operate an opt-in booking system for this machine.

It's called an opt-in booking system because you can still use it before/after your booked time or without a booking, but you may have to share with other members.

Please read our full tool sharing and booking policy [here](/policies/fair-use#tool-sharing) for details.

# Booking Policy

> You must book to use the CNC machine. Bookings have priority.
{.is-warning}

## Booking Durations and Notice Period

**Business Hours (7am to 7 pm)** 
- No notice period
- 2 hours max booking timeslot (you may continue use unless someone else has booked or shown up to use)

**Outside Business Hours (7pm to 7am)**
- 48 hours notice period
- May book up to 8 hours

# Recommended Uses
The CNC router is great for all sorts of things like making detailed 3D models, large project enclosures and general cutting/engraving. It can cut and engrave things large or small, and most types of materials including plastic, timber and soft metals like aluminium. Please note that it cannot be used with very hard materials like steel.

# Specifications
**IP Address**: 192.168.2.6:23
**Manufacturer:** [CNC3D](https://www.cnc3d.com.au)
**Model:** [QueenBee CNC 1000x1500mm](https://www.cnc3d.com.au/product-page/queenbee-cnc-1000x1500mm/)
**Induction Class:** üü° Yellow Tool (**Induction Required**)
**Usable Work Area:** Approx. 1200x750mm
**Z Travel:** Approx. 110mm (this is **not** the max cut depth!)
**Max Cut Depth:** 94mm ‚Äì Material Thickness (read more at the bottom of [this page](https://www.cnc3d.com.au/product-page/queenbee-cnc-1000x1500mm)).

## Endmills / Router Bits
**We do not provide any endmill bits** because they are expensive and break easily. It is your responsibility to source compatible bits and bring them with you. Our induction fee includes 2x router bits so you can get started right away, but they aren't suitable for every material/project.

We highly recommend that you source your router bits from [CNC 3D](https://www.cnc3d.com.au). They are based on the Gold Coast, and all of their bits are already included in our endmill library. You can find their bits available online below. They ship with express shipping or have local pick up. **Endmills / Router Bits with a diameter of up to 6mm are supported.**

[Order your CNC 3D endmills / router bits here](https://www.cnc3d.com.au/endmills)

## BMS Endmills
If you have a once-off project that uses a specialty endmill, you may borrow one of the makerspace ones on the condition that if you damage it in anyway, you must buy it for the full retail price. You can contact the head maker to organise this.

Here's a list of all the endmill bits that BMS generally has on site:
* coming soon.

## Software
We use CarveCo and have a license for CarveCo Maker installed on the CNC Computer. This computer is setup just for running this CNC machine, and generally shouldn't be used for other purposes.

This software is called "CAM" software and is not capable of designing models. To design models, you need to use CAD software like Tinkercad or Fusion 360. CAM software is very difficult and complex to use.

# Induction Process
**‚ö†Ô∏è This tool requires an induction before use.**

It's loud and messy, and can cause serious injury or damage if used incorrectly.

This induction process requires a payment of $30 to cover the cost of the 2 endmill bits used during the induction (you get to keep these). You must read this entire wiki page, and watch every video listed below ***before*** booking in. If you don't follow these steps, you will not be able to complete your induction.

### Step 1
**Watch all videos prior to booking induction:**
* coming soon.

### Step 2
Book an induction session here: *Booking link coming soon.*
