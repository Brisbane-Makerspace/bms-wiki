# Introduction
Our iMacs are setup with all of the software you need to run our digital fabrication tools. You can also use them (when others are not using them to operate tools) for CAD and graphic design tasks.

# How to use
> Whilst we take reasonable precautions, we make no guarantees as to the security or reliability of these machines. BMS cannot be held responsible for any viruses, data loss, or other losses resulting from the use of our computers. They are regularly erased/reset and you should not expect data stored on them to be kept long term.

Each iMac should have a "Brisbane Makerspace" user account at minimum. This is the account you should use. If the iMac is not logged in, you can simply click on the "Brisbane Makerspace" user to automatically login. If prompted for a password, leave it blank and press enter.

Our iMacs run macOS, which may look unfamiliar if you're used to using Windows on a PC or other laptop. They are very user friendly, and simple to use. The main difference is use "command + shortcut_key" instead of "control + shortcut_key" for all of your keyboard short cuts like copy/pasting. The other main difference is the program to access all of your files is called "Finder" (the blue/white smiley face) rather than "File Explorer".

The USB ports (ie for connecting a flash drive) are located on the rear right hand side. The power button is located on the rear left hand side.
