# Introduction
Brisbane Makerspace offers a set of basic electronics consumables for members to use.

Reasonable quanities of consumables listed on this page are included in your membership fee. We reserve the right to charge you for unreasonable or commerical use of consumables as per our [Community Rules](/policies/communityrules).


## Consumables
We try to stock the following at all times:
* Heat shrink tubing (various sizes and colours)
* Soldering wire (1mm and 2mm)
* Silicon hookup wire (various colours)
* Side cutters (we consider these consumable as they break often)
* Steel wool (for cleaning soldering iron tips)
* Spare soldering iron tips
