# Recommended Uses
These are great for general purpose testing and troubleshooting of your electronic circuits as they can measure voltage, resistance, continuity, etc.

# Specifications
**Induction Class:** Green Tool (No Induction Required)
**Model:** UNI-T UT136A
**Max Voltage:** 500v
**Max Current:** 10A
**Max Resistance:** 40MOhm
**Frequency:** 10Hz to 10MHz
**Measures:** Voltage, Current, Resistance, Diodes, Frequency, Continuity

# Induction Process
No induction required.

However, we do offer an electronics workshop for a complete introduction to electronics, including digital multimeters.

# How To Operate
You should be familiar with how to operate this tool after completing an induction. However, a quick reference guide is included below to assist you.

> Note: never play with electricity unless you know what you are doing. Even at low voltages you can still receive a shock! Never measure mains voltages unless you are a qualified electrician.

## Before Use
1. Insert the cables into the common, and voltage, current (< 400mA) or current (400mA - 10A) connectors.
> Do not measure voltage with the probes inserted into the current holes, or current with the probes inserted into the voltage hole. Doing so will damage the multimeter.
{.is-warning}
2. Turn the meter on to the correct setting.
3. Push the probes onto the thing you want to measure.

## During Use
1. Do not push too hard, but a solid connection is required for an accurate reading.

## After Use
1. Turn off, then wrap cables around the multimeter and return to it's home.
