## Before Use
1. Make sure your circuit is not connected to the power supply.
2. Turn on the main power switch on the front.
3. Set the voltage limit. Turn the current limit all the way down, then back half a turn.
4. Connect the ground and positive power rail carefully.
5. Increase the current limit (if needed) after verifying everything is hooked up correctly.

## During Use
1. Watch the power supply **at all times** while it is powering something.
2. Never leave the power supplys unatended if it is switched on.
3. Never use the power supply to charge a battery unless you have checked with staff first.

## After Use
1. Turn off the main power switch on the front.
2. Unplug your circuit.
3. Neatly loop the cables over the top of the power supply.
