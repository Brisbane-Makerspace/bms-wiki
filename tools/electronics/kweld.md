# Induction Process
This induction has two parts:

1. Watch our online video induction (coming soon, for now skip to #2).
2. Visit us during staffed hours to get signed off.

# How To Operate
You should be familiar with how to operate this tool after completing an induction. However, a quick reference guide is included below to assist you.

## Before Use
1. Allow the hot air or soldering iron to reach temperature.
2. Clean the soldering iron tip in the steel wool once heated up.

## During Use
1. Never leave the soldering iron or hot air sitting on the bench. Always return them to their holders when not in your hands.
2. Pay careful attention not to touch the soldering iron tip or direct the hot air onto your skin or other things like wire insulation, etc.
3. For soldering, hold both things together (or use a soldering third hand) and heat them with the iron. Slowly push soldering wire into the joint and allow it to become covered in solder. Keep the soldered joint still until it has cooled down.
4. For hot air, carefully direct the hot air around the heat shrink or component, avoiding other components/wires nearby. 

## After Use
1. Wipe down the soldering iron tip in the steel wool and return the tool(s) to their holder(s).
2. Remove all bits of loose heat shrink, wires, insulation cutoffs, etc. from the work area.
