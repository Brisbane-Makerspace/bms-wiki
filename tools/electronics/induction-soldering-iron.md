## Before Use
1. Pick up the "pen" and allow it to reach temperature.
2. Clean the soldering iron tip in the steel wool/sponge once heated up.

## During Use
1. Never leave the soldering iron on the bench. Always return it to its holder when not in your hands.
2. Pay careful attention not to touch the soldering iron tip onto your skin or other things like wire insulation, etc.
3. To solder, hold both things together (or use a soldering third hand) and heat them with the iron. Slowly push soldering wire into the joint and allow it to become covered in solder. Keep the soldered joint still until it has cooled down.

## After Use
1. Wipe down the soldering iron tip in the steel wool and return the "pen" to its holder.
2. Remove all bits of loose heat shrink, wires, insulation cutoffs, etc. from the work area.
