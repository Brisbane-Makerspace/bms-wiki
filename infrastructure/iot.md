# Front Doorbell
The front doorbell is an Amazon Ring Doorbell that communicates with the Alexa unit on the shelves to the left of the door. Due to past issues with the setup, the Google Home next to it is also set up to notify whenever the door buzzer is pressed.

## Interacting with the doorbell
When the button on the doorbell is pressed, a chime is played and the message "Someone is at the front door" will play through both Alexa and the Google Home. At this point, the camera feed from the doorbell should show up on the Alexa unit. You can then tap the screen, unmute and have a conversation with the person on the other end. 
If there is no response within a certain amount of time, Alexa will play a message inviting the user to leave a message.

At any time, you can say "Alexa, show the front door" and the video feed will pop up on the screen.
