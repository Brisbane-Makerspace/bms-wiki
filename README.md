# The official BMS wiki repo

Members are required to use the GUI interface to make changes to our wiki website. This Git repo is used as a backup for all of our wiki content, and for audit trails and transparency purposes. Content from the wiki is synced here approximately once every 2 minutes.

# BMS Policy
For policy changes however, we require it to go through an approval process here on GitHub. Once a change is made to a policy in the `/policy` folder, it should appear on our wiki within 2 minutes. The "Policy Policy" is outlined on our wiki [here](https://s.bms.wiki/policies). If you need help contributing, please jump into [discord](https://s.bms.wiki/discord) and let us know!
