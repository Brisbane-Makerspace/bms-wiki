# Woodshop Working Group
Working Groups are how we get stuff done in a decentralised, but accountable way. Welcome to the *Woodshop* Working Group's wiki page.

# Purpose
The Woodshop Working Group is dedicated to managing and enhancing the woodshop facilities at BMS. Our goal is to ensure a safe and well-organized environment for all members interested in woodworking. This includes maintaining and upgrading tools and equipment, fostering a culture of safety and skill-building, and facilitating workshops and projects that engage and benefit the community.

# Members

This budget can be spent on approval by the Facilitator for any reason. However, it is typically used for small and inconsistent expenses like restocking consumables or minor repairs.

### Amount

# Policies
## 1. Woodshop Layout
Any changes to the layout of the woodshop (including the position of permanent extension leads/work tables etc.) must be approved by the Facilitator or at a Working Group meeting.
