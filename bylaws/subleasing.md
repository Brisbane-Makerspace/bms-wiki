# Subleasing Policy

Typically, subleasing of any area will not be approved due to the limited space we have. However, should any space become available, the following policy will apply:
1. Subleases can only be approved at a General Meeting and must contain a detailed plan of the area to be leased and any special conditions.
2. Subleases must be charged at the cost of rent the association pays per square metre, plus 20% to cover outgoings and other costs.
3. Subleases must be signed on a rolling 30 day term - that is no long term leases are permitted and 30 days notice to terminate the lease can be given to the tenant after a motion to terminate the sublease is carried at a general meeting. There is no right to appeal termination of a sublease.
4. All tenants must have a minimum $20 million in public liability insurance that adequately covers what they do.
5. A security bond equivalent to 3 months rent is required to be collected prior to any sublease commencing and cannot be returned until the sublease has ended and the space has been returned to the prior condition.
6. Sub-leases must name a responsible person as a guarantor and that person must be a member of the association and ensure none of their guests are on site unless they are supervised by someone with a swipe card.
7. If the responsible member's membership is terminated, the 30 day notice period automatically starts and they must vacate within 30 days.
8. All persons who are to access the subleased space on a regular basis must complete the general onboarding induction and may be issued a swipe card at the discretion of the Head Maker.
