# [DRAFT] Donations and Loans Policy
We rely significantly on the generosity of our members and supporters to operate BMS. Most of our tools and equipment have been donated by someone. This policy aims to provide a consistent process and set expectations appropriately.

BMS is a registered charity and has DGR status. This means if you donate something and meet certain requirements, it may be tax deductible. We cannot provide financial or legal advice, but check out [this guide](/howto/dgr-donation) for general guidance on this process. Not all donations are considered deductible, so please carefully read the guide above if that is important.

## Donation vs Loan
The main difference between a donation vs a loan is that a donation is a one way process. A donation means you're transferring ownership of that asset to BMS. A loan on the other hand, allows you to retain ownership and loan it to BMS so our members and community can use it. If you loan something to BMS, you may receive support to help maintain and repair it. The specifics are explained below.

# Donations
The donations policy is:
1. A donation is a gift of cash or an asset of value that is given to BMS.
2. Once a donation has been made to BMS, we can use it as we see fit, including to destroy or sell it if deemed the best use of that donation.
3. Before a donation can be accepted, it must be approved by one of the following:
		1. any member of the Committee; or
  	2. any Working Group facilitator; or
  	3. a motion at a general meeting or Working Group meeting.
4. A donation cannot be accepted if it's any of the following:
		1. it poses an unacceptable safety risk - like containing hazardous materials or components; or
    2. equipment and appliances that don't work unless they will be stripped for parts or repaired; or
    3. obsolete equipment and appliances unless they have educational or cultural value; or
    4. something that is unlikely to be used and unable to be sold easily; or
    5. something that is clearly not appropriate to receive such as items that breach our safe space policy or code of conduct; or
    6. something from an organisation or individual that doesn't align with our cultural values.
5. If there is any doubt over whether or not a donation should be accepted, the decision should be made by a motion at a general meeting or relevant Working Group meeting.
6. For any donation that is a tool or equipment to be used by members, before it can be accepted, there must be someone responsible for processing the donation and bringing it up to the standards we require for documentation and inductions etc.
7. A donation may be given to a member or other person if it's of no use and has no commercial value (ie cannot be easily sold).
8. A donation may not have any strings attached to it, including expectations of favours or work done in return. This does not prevent a token of appreciation/grattitude like a small sign or similar being agreed to. Exceptions to this rule may be made by a motion at a general meeting.

# Loans
The loans policy is:
1. A loan is an asset (generally a tool or piece of equipment) that is being temporarily loaned to BMS so members can use it.
2. Ownership of the loaned asset is retained by the loaner.
3. Before a loan can be accepted, it must be approved by one of the following:
		1. any member of the Committee; or
  	2. any Working Group facilitator; or
  	3. a motion at a general meeting or Working Group meeting.
4. A loan cannot be accepted if it's any of the following:
		1. it poses an unacceptable safety risk - like containing hazardous materials or components; or
    2. equipment and appliances that don't work unless they will be stripped for parts or repaired; or
    3. obsolete equipment and appliances unless they have educational or cultural value; or
    4. something that is unlikely to be used and unable to be sold easily; or
    5. something that is clearly not appropriate to receive such as items that breach our safe space policy or code of conduct; or
    6. something from an organisation or individual that doesn't align with our cultural values.
5. If there is any doubt over whether or not a loan should be accepted, the decision should be made by a motion at a general meeting or relevant Working Group meeting.
6. For any loan that is a tool or equipment to be used by members, before it can be accepted, there must be someone responsible for processing the loan and bringing it up to the standards we require for documentation and inductions etc.
7. A loan can only be accepted after a loan agreement has been made. The default loan agreement may be used, but any changes to it must be approved at a Working Group or general meeting.
8. The loan agreement and owner must be included on the wiki page for the loaned item.

## Default Loan Agreement
1. The loaned item will be stored in a shared environment, and can be used by any member in line with induction and other reasonable requirements.
2. The owner agrees that BMS is not liable for any damage or loss to the loaned item. However, we'll do our best to be reasonable in the unlikely event that something like this occurs.
3. The item may be modified, repaired, or upgraded without notice by BMS if it's unlikely to impact it's functionality. Any major modifications, repairs, or upgrades, require the owner's permission.
4. BMS will do it's best to keep the loaned item running well and maintained.
5. BMS will be responsible for the cost of any modifications, repairs or upgrades it decides to do and for consumables it supplies for use.
6. The loan is assumed to be indefinite, and requires 14 days notice before it can be returned to the owner. However, reasonable exceptions to this may be approved by the Head Maker or a Working Group faciliator.
7. If the owner cannot be contacted in a reasonable period of time (at least 30 days minimum), the loaned item automatically becomes a donation.
