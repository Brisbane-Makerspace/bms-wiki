# Crafting Working Group
## Purpose of working group

To manage and enhance the arts and crafts facilities at BMS for members interested in craft activities. This includes maintaining tools and materials, providing a safe and productive environment for members to use said tools and creating opportunities for members to build skills and collaborate on projects through workshops and events.

## Members
- Emily Taylor (Facilitator)
- Adam Jacobus

## Budgets
### Discretionary Budget
This budget can be spent on approval by the Facilitator for any reason. However, it is typically used for small and inconsistent expenses like restocking consumables or minor repairs.

Amount: $100 per month (non-accruing)
