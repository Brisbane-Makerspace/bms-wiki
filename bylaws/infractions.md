# Infraction Policy
Everyone is human, and we try not to unreasonably penalise or reprimand people for genuine mistakes. However, patterns of mistakes or more serious instances of bad behaviour need to be dealt with appropriately. Our Infraction policy is how we do that.

## What is an infraction?
The way we identify bad behaviour (whether intentional or not) is with an *Infraction*. An Infraction is our way of identifying that you breached one of our policies or expectations, and recording that for future reference. Members are encouraged to report all behaviour that may be worthy of an Infraction.

The committee must issue an Infraction in all cases where there is clear evidence a breach occured. Infractions are just a record and don't always necessitate a punishment as described below. Most members will receive an Infraction at some point. They only become a problem if a pattern emerges.

## Penalties
If an Infraction is serious enough to necessitate some form of penalty, or a pattern of bad behaviour is identified, an Infraction should be accompanied by a penalty. A penalty will usually be a Tempoary Access Suspension but may be another form of "making good" such as cleaning up a mess or paying for a tool that was damaged. The committee can decide to issue any type of penalty that they feel is necessary and reasonable to rectify the Infraction.

A penalty cannot be in the form of a fine or monetary penalty unless there was a direct cost to BMS. In this case, any monetary penalty must not be greater than the actual cost incurred by BMS. Fines are not an equitable penalty in most cases and we avoid them.

## Access Suspension
A penalty may come in the form of a Temporary Access Suspension. This does not change your membership status or entitlement to vote etc. However, during the Temporary Access Suspension period, you are not permitted to:
* Come on site without written permission from the committee. It is the committee's absolute discretion to allow you to come on-site during this time (for example, to collect personal belongings).
* Use any physical BMS resource or facility.

During a Temporary Access Suspension, you are required to maintain your membership by paying your fees. If you do not wish to pay membership while you have an Access Suspension, you can cancel your membership.

## Infractions must be recorded
All infractions must be recorded on the official member forum in the private "infractions" category. It is critical that all infractions issued must be recorded here and remain available to any member at any time. This ensures 100% transparency and allows us to record patterns of behaviour that occur over time.

If infractions are hidden or not recorded properly, it makes it difficult to identify and rectify patterns of bad behaviour. A record of an infraction must include the member's name, when it happened, what the infraction was, and clear evidence of the infraction.

# Infraction Schedule
The Infraction Schedule contains a list of behaviours that must receive an infraction. Each Infraction is accompanied by a suggested penalty, but the actual penalty issued may be slightly different depending on the situation.

## Escalation
Each time an Infraction is issued in a category, the penalty should become more severe. Each category outlines the expected escalation of a penalty and should be treated separately from each other category. For the purpose of escalation, infractions expire after 4 years.

**Once a member has been issued with the maximum number of Infractions in any category, they are required to demonstrate why their membership shouldn't be cancelled.** This is 4x offences for Category 1, 3x for Category 2, and 2x for Category 3.

## Category 1
These Infractions are minor, and first time breaches **should not** be accompanied by a Temporary Access Suspension penalty (but another penalty like cleaning up their mess is fine). However, after the first breach, each additional breach should be accompanied by a Temporary Access Suspension going from 1 week, to 2 weeks, then up to 4 weeks.

* Unintentionally breaching the Safe Space Policy or Code of Conduct.
* Not cleaning up after yourself (e.g. leaving a mess and not tidying the area that you used).
* Not locking up or securing the site in accordance with site lockup procedures.
* Not reporting a safety or maintenance issue that you discovered (even if you didn't cause it).
* Leaving a battery, capacitor, or something similar charging unattended.
* Causing minor (repairable) damage to a tool due to unreasonable misuse or negligence.
* Causing BMS to breach any condition of our lease not already defined in a category.
* Any other *minor* breach of a policy not already defined in a category.
* Doing something that needs to be added to this Category.

## Category 2
These Infractions are more severe than Category 1, and first time breaches **should** be accompanied by a Temporary Access Suspension penalty. Each breach should be accompanied by a Temporary Access Suspension going from 1 week, to 2 weeks, then up to 4 weeks.

* Intentionally breaching the Safe Space Policy or Code of Conduct.
* Not reporting a safety or maintenance issue that you caused or contributed to (e.g. you broke a tool and didn't report it). This includes making and leaving dangerous items like exposed extension cords, etc.
* Causing a significant nuisance to BMS such as engaging in Unreasonable Complainant Conduct as defined by the Federal Ombudsman.
* Using a tool contrary to its official process or without meeting all of its induction requirements (such as using it without being inducted).
* Intentionally using a tool in an unsafe manner (ie cutting coconuts on the chopsaw).
* Leaving a tool running and leaving the immediate area (except for tools allowed to be left unattended like the 3D printers).
* Modifying a tool, including performing maintenance, without consent of relevant Working Group (except for things permitted as per its wiki page).
* Helping another person (whether or not they are a member) to use facilities they are not entitled to such as swiping on a tool for them.
* Performing unlicensed electrical work or working on high voltage projects (including fractal burning) that are illegal under QLD state law. This generally means anything >60V AC or 120V ripple free DC without supervision of an electrician.
* Attempting to access the physical BMS site without being a member (other than during public events, tours, etc.).
* Any other *major* breach of a policy not already defined in another category.
* Doing something that needs to be added to this Category.

## Category 3
These Infractions are major, and first time breaches **should be treated seriously**. Every breach should be accompanied by an Access Suspension going from 1 month, then 2 months, but this may be longer in serious cases.

* Anything not defined in another category that's illegal. Including, but not limited to:
	* Physical or verbal assault of another person.
  * Serious bullying, harassing, or threatening another person.
  * Using or being under the influence of illicit substances and attemping to access the physical BMS site.
  * Using or being under the influence of alcohol and attempting to use any tool.
  * Using or being under the influence of any other substance (including presciption medication) that may impair your ability to safely operate a tool, and attempting to use that tool.
* Accessing (or attempting to acces) BMS facilities during a Temporary Access Suspension.
* Not completing a required action as part of an Infraction penalty (e.g., not cleaning up a mess you were required to, etc.).
* Attempting to cover up, hide, or seriously misrepresent an incident.
* Using a tool in a way that is likely to cause serious personal injury or death (e.g. using a lathe with the chuck key installed, or removing a safety guide/barrier from a tool in an unreasonable situation).
* Defeating a safety interlock or access system (without explicit permission) to use a tool or resource.
    * This includes if you are usually entitled to use it - but your swipe is rejected or declined.
* Severely damaging any of our tools due to intentional misuse or unreasonable negligence.
* Doing something that needs to be added to this Category.
