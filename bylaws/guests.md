# Guests
Outside of our publically advertised events, site access is only available to paid up members and their supervised guests.

If you're a member wanting to bring a guest along, you must follow these rules:
* No more than 3 people are allowed to accompany you as a guest (more may be permitted at the discretion of the committee).
* Guests are not allowed to use yellow or red tools. They can watch/learn, but they cannot use these tools directly themselves.
* You and your guest(s) must be working on the same project - ie one project per membership.
* Guests may be asked to leave by any member of the committee for any reasonable reason. Examples include (but are not limited to):
	* your guest is causing a nuisance; or
  * there are too many people at BMS; or
  * your guest is breaching a policy.
* Guests are not permitted to work on projects generating commercial value unless you have a special commercial arrangement in place. It's fine to bring a co-worker if they're just watching, but if they're contributing to the project they need a membership.
	* A guest who is a family member/partner is excluded from this rule.
