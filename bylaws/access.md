# Access & Accounts (Priviledged Access Policy)

Brisbane Makerspace has a number of digital resources/services that are restricted in access to members other than those requiring them to perform their volunteer roles.

If a resource is restricted in this way, it is published in the Access Register, which is a public document recording the following:
- The resource
- Reasons for restriction
- What is required to maintain/gain access
- The access manager for the resource

As these resources are typically digital in nature, it is the remit of the Infrastructure Working Group to ensure the register is up to date.

## Notification
Notification of modification of access must consist of at a minimum a written notification. This may include notifications from services directly.

In the case of removal of access, there must be a grace period of at least 48 hours before the access is removed. This may be waived in exceptional circumstances by a vote of the committee.

## Password Management
Where access is controlled by shared accounts with single passwords, access will only be issued by providing the user with access to the password control system currently in place. When access is revoked to password control, accounts that user had access to should have their passwords updated, unless 2FA/MFA is in place.

Passwords are not to be issued out to people outside of the password control system.
