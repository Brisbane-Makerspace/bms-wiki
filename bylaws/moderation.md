Violation of the Code of Conduct are grounds for removing contributions or curtailing your contribution privileges on the resource.

These Guidelines are followed by all of BMS’s Moderators. Any member can contribute to keeping discourse civil by flagging/Reporting content that violate these guidelines.

Moderation Guidelines:
Flagged/reported content will be reviewed according to the following guidelines.
