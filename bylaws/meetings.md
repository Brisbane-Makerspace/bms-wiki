# Meetings
Please see the [constitution](/constitution#h-38-procedure-and-voting-at-general-meeting) (Sections 35-39) for information on how meetings are required to be run and how our consensus voting process works.

## Notice requirements for certain agenda items
The following types of agenda items must be published at least 3 days prior to the meeting in order to be added to the agenda for that meeting. Items that fail to meet this requirement must be tabled for the next general meeting.

For the avoidance of doubt, 3 days includes the day of the meeting, and does not have to be a full 24 hour period. E.g. the deadline for a meeting at 8pm on Monday would be midnight on the Friday prior.

Items requiring notice:
* All items that require a vote (including a vote by consensus)

## Regular meeting time
The organisation should host the regular general meeting on the first and third Monday of each month at 8pm but may hold additional meetings as deemed necessary.
