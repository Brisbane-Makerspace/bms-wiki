# Safe Space Policy
One of our goals as an organisation is to create a friendly and welcoming space that is safer for everyone. Our [code of conduct](/bylaws/coc) and safe space policy defines how we do this.

We acknowledge that no space is 100% safe. Sometimes oppressive and discriminatory behaviour is hard to recognise, but we do our best to recognise and reduce the impact.

## Mandatory Reporting
We have a mandatory reporting policy for all breaches of our Safe Space Policy and Code of Conduct. If you witness someone breaching either of these policies, you are obligated to report the incident to the committee.

*"The standard you walk past is the standard you accept."* - If you don't take steps to stop discriminatory, oppressive or otherwise unacceptable behaviour, you are helping to perpetuate it.

## Expect to be challenged
If you breach any of our policies and procedures, in particular our [code of conduct](/bylaws/coc) or this safe space policy, expect to be challenged. If you see someone else breaching our policies and procedures, (respectfully) challenge them. Serious or repeated breaches will result in you being asked to leave.

## Discrimination and Inclusivity
We don't tolerate discriminatory behaviour ever. An important part of our safe space policy is respecting and using a person's correct gender pronouns and name at all times (even if they are not present).

Behaviour that is **not tolerated at any time** incudes:
* sexism, racism, ableism or ageism
* misogyny/homophobia/transphobia/queerphobia
* religious or political vilification
* prejudice based on appearance, gender presentation, language ability, migration status, or class

## Oppressive and non-consenual behaviour
We don't tolerate oppressive and non-consensual behaviour ever. There is no excuse and you will get no warnings before being asked to leave.

Members are expected to:
* Receive explicit verbal consent before touching someone or entering their personal space (ie hugging them, pushing their wheelchair, etc.).
* Respect other people's opinions, personal experiences and personal space.
* Acknowledge the impact of your actions, regardless of your intent.
* Be responsible and accountable for your own actions.
* Actively challenge discriminatory or oppressive behaviour.
* Take steps to educate yourself about unfamiliar concepts in order to prevent direct or indirect oppression.
  * Ignorance is not a reasonable excuse for perpetuating oppression or discriminatory behaviour.
