# Storage at BMS
We have very limited space on site, so this storage policy explains what our expectations and requirements are.

# 1. Storage Locations
1. Storage of personal items is not permitted anywhere on-site, except where permitted below.

2. You may not store any dangerous substances or chemicals anywhere on site without written permission from the Head Maker or unless another policy explicitly permits you to.

## 2. Member Storage Shelves
1. You can claim up to one cube in the member storage shelves as long as you are a member and require one. You can do so on a permanent or temporary basis.

2. To claim a permanent spot, let the head maker know so a label can be printed. To claim a temporary spot, store your items and affix a Green Ticket as explained below.

3. All items stored must fit entirely within the cube without sticking out.

## 3. Temporary Project Storage
We recognise that sometimes you may need to leave a project on-site while the paint is drying or glue is setting, etc.

1. You are permitted to leave one project on site if it's too big to fit in your storage cube and you can't reasonably transport it home.
		1. This project must not be stored on a workspace and must be stored out of the way so as not to inconvenience another member.

2. You must attach a Green Ticket to all items stored outside of a permanent storage cube.

Examples of following this policy:
* You leave a painting that you've been working on above the member storage shelves with a Green Ticket on it, and you come back to collect it in a few days.
* You store a large piece of wood on the basement shelves with a Green Ticket on it as it's too big to take home on the bus. You come back in 2 weeks to finish it off and take it off site.

Examples of not following this policy:
* You leave a 3D print with glue waiting to dry above the member storage shelves but forget to put a Green Ticket on it.
* You leave your project on a workspace and put a Green Ticket on it.

## 4. Large Project Storage
1. You may store one large project on site, at the discretion of the Head Maker, or by carrying a motion at a general meeting.
2. You must not exceed the time limit imposed, which may not be longer than 3 months, unless a longer time is approved at a general meeting.
		1. If the approved time limit is exceeded, it may be disposed of off site.
3. You must store it in the way approved by the Head Maker or the motion carried at a general meeting, and it must always have a Green Ticket attached to all loose parts of it.
4. A security bond may be required to be collected prior to the project coming on site; and
		1.  may be an amount up to the estimated cost of having a professional remove your project and dispose of it; and
    2. cannot be returned until the project has been removed off site; and
    3. may be partially returned if a cost was incurred by the makerspace to remove it off site.

# Tickets
## 5. Green Ticket
1. Green tickets are required to be attached to all items left on-site outside of your permanent and labelled storage cube.

2. Green Tickets allow you to store something on site for up to 30 days at a time and must be renewed with a new one prior to expiry.

3. Any item found with an expired green ticket, or no ticket, will be issued with a red ticket.

## 6. Red Storage Ticket
1. Red tickets offer a formal warning that this item is not allowed to be here. Once a red ticket has been attached to an item, you have 14 days to rectify the problem identified. You must either attach a green ticket to it (if appropriate) or remove it off-site, etc.

2. A good faith effort must be made to find out and contact the owner of the item when a red ticket is attached to it, and throughout the 14 day period it is attached. This may be satisfied by posting an image on Discord if the owner is unknown.

3. Once a red ticket ticket has expired, the makerspace may choose to dispose of the item or handle it as they see fit.

## 7. Yellow Ticket
Typically we repair tools pretty quickly, but sometimes we need to wait on parts etc.

1. If a tool can't be safely used, it must have a Yellow Ticket attached to it. This will explain what's wrong with the tool and when it's expected to be fixed.

2. Yellow Ticket tools are **not to be used** (unless it says otherwise on the ticket) until the ticket has been removed, or you are authorised by the relevant Working Group or Head Maker.

3. If you break a tool, or come across a tool, you are required to fill in and attach a Yellow Ticket.

## 8. Disclaimer
Anything that is left on site unattended, is done so at your own risk. The makerspace takes no responsibility for anything that may happen to items you leave on-site. Any items found to be in breach of this policy may be disposed of after 14 days of being in breach as per the Red Ticket policy.
