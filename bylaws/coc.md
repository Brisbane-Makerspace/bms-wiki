# Introduction
Brisbane Makerspace aims to foster an inclusive and friendly culture for all members. Our Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for community behaviour which are important to keep in mind.

If you see any behaviour contrary to our Code of Conduct, you are encouraged to politely remind those involved that it is not appropriate. In addition, you should report any serious breaches to the committee.

The code of conduct can be summarised with the following topics:
* Be respectful
* Be inclusive and never discriminate
* Zero-tolerance on abuse/violence/bullying
* Always be honest
* Don't inappropriately use our resources
* Be mindful of confidentiality/privacy
* Wear appropriate clothing/shoes
* Don't be a nuisance

## Respect
It is important to treat everyone with respect and consideration at all times. This includes being respectful to volunteers, other members, guests, and our facilities. Always be considerate in how you treat others and all of our facilities.

Examples of being respectful:
 - Leaving your work area as clean, or cleaner than you found it. 
 - Returning tools where you found them, or identifying misplaced tools.
 - Only storing materials on site that you actively need for a current project.
 - Taking care of trash you generate when using the facilities that can't be disposed of easily.

Examples not not being respectful:
* Not leaving enough time before you need to leave and leaving behind a mess.
* Overfilling a bin instead of emptying it.
* Leaving tools around and not returning them.

## Discrimination and Inclusivity
Brisbane Makerspace is a safe space for everyone. Any sort of discrimination, marginalisation, or similar, based on a personal characteristic protected by law, is strictly prohibited. Any other behaviour not listed explicitly, but that makes someone feel uncomfortable or discriminated against is also not acceptable.

An important part of our Code of Conduct is respecting and using a person's correct gender pronouns and name. Mistakes happen, but repeated misgendering or misnaming someone is not acceptable.

Behaviour that is **not tolerated at any time** incude:
* sexism
* racism
* ableism
* homophobic or transphobic behaviour
* religious or political persecution


## Abuse, Violence & Bullying
Abuse and violence of any kind are strictly prohibited. This includes verbal/physical assault, harassment, bullying, intimidation and similar behaviour. We have a zero-tolerance policy for abuse and violence.

Behaviour that is **not tolerated at any time** include:
* Threatening someone because they are taking too long on a tool.
* Calling someone a name or doing practical jokes that they don't like.
* Yelling at a member because they broke something.
* Manipulating someone to do something (including volunteer) that they clearly don't want to do.
* Unfairly targetting a member that you don't like.

## Honesty
Honesty is an important aspect of our community. We know that sometimes not everything goes to plan, and accidents happen. However, it's always better to be upfront about something, even if it means admitting you did something wrong.

**Being honest is always the right thing to do**, and any sort of dishonesty (including lying by omission, etc.) goes against this code of conduct. If you leave a mess, break a tool, or do something wrong, please let us know before someone finds out.

Examples of being honest include:
* Letting the right person know that you broke a tool.
* Admitting when you broke a policy or didn't follow a process.
* Acknowledge your own skill level and seek help when you need it.

Examples of not being honest include:
* Breaking a tool and putting it back hoping no-one will notice.
* Accidentally breaking a policy and then covering it up.

## Acceptable Use
We operate a shared workspace for the benefit of the community. Our resources and facilities should never be used in a way that may bring the organisation into disrespute. This includes things that may actually be, or perceived to be, illegal, unconscionable, immoral, or anything of similar nature.

Examples of acceptable uses include:
* Developing social connections
* Learning new skills

Examples of unacceptable uses include:
* Making discriminatory signs/propaganda
* Any illegal activity

## Confidentiality & Privacy
Sometimes times you may learn about confidential or private information in the course of being a member. Any personal information, or information that may be sensitive/confidential in nature should never be shared without explicit consent. Doing so may be illegal, immoral, or even put the organisation at risk of not getting a grant.

Examples of information that should not be shared without explicit consent:
* Details in an application for a grant
* Clauses in a lease or contract we have already, or are about to sign
* Private information about a member (like a health condition, contact details, etc.)

## Dress Code
Appropriate clothing, including closed-in shoes, must be worn at all times.

Examples of appropriate clothing include:
* Closed in shoes
* Wearing a shirt and shorts

Examples of inappropriate clothing include:
* Not wearing a shirt because it's too hot
* Walking around bare foot
* Wearing something with an inapropriate slogan

## Nuisance Behaviour
Any other behaviour not described in this Code of Conduct, but would be considered by a reasonable person to cause a nuisance is prohibited. Behaviour that is considered "unreasonable complainant conduct" by the Queensland/Federal ombudsman also falls into this category.

Examples of nuisance behaviour:
* Unreasonably persisting with a complaint after it has been dealt with.
* Playing loud music after being asked to stop.
* Repeatedly interrupting/bothering people when they clearly want to be left alone.
