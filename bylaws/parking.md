# Parking Policy
Brisbane Makerspace has **two** assigned parking spaces and **one** loading bay (requires blocking in the other two spaces). Members may only access them in accordance with this policy.

For tips on nearby parking locations off site, please see our [getting there](/getting-there) page.

These parking spaces are provided on a first in first served basis for member convenience and availability is not guaranteed. BMS takes absolutely no responsibility for any damage or loss that occurs as a result of you using our parking spaces. Parking is done at your own risk.

## Restrictions
* 1 membership card = 1 carpark space. Carpark spaces cannot be used by guests you invite to BMS unless you are driving in the car with them.
* Members are entitled to park on site for a maximum of 6 hours total per day.
  * If you leave and come back, move to another park, etc. this does not reset the time limit.
* Whilst your car is parked in one of our parking spaces, you must remain physically on site at Brisbane Makerspace.
  * These are not car parks you can use when you are nearby.
  * Short trips off site (<30 minutes) to get lunch etc. is fine, but you cannot be gone longer than this.
* Carpark spaces cannot be used by motorcycles or vehicles that do not fit entirely within the marked carpark spaces.
* Any member of the committee can ask you to move your vehicle offsite for any reasonable reason and at any time without notice.

## Neighbouring Carparks
There are other carparks within our shared carpark that are signed for BMS use. These are not for members to use as they are leased by other tenants. If members park in these carparks during business hours, your car may be stickered or towed.

## Breach of these conditions
If you breach any of these conditions, your vehicle may be stickered and/or towed away from site. You will be required to pay the towing fee (up to $271.25) directly to the tow company to release your vehicle. If your vehicle is towed you can call the number on the carpark signage for collection details.
