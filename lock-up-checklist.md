# Locking up Brisbane Makerspace
- If you’re leaving during our staffed hours, we’ll lock up when we leave so there’s nothing to worry about.
- However, if you’re leaving after staffed hours, you are responsible for making sure the site is completely secure.
- Here’s a checklist of everything that you must check before you leave:
  - All tools have been signed off (even if you didn’t sign them on, please sign them off)
  - All windows and the balcony door has been closed and latched.
  - You have checked out of site using the members app.
  - You have pressed the master light switch near the main door to turn off all lights and air conditioning.
  - You have closed the two main doors behind you, and have checked that each one latched closed.
