# How to host an event at BMS
Based on what I can remember from my chat with Jaimyn, the main steps goes something like this:

## Before you start
It's wonderful that you are thinking about or have decided to contribute to the community by hosting an event at BMS. It is another way to help keep the makerspace buzzing with creativity and energy, and a very good way to shape the culture and conversation around the place.

To ensure that events are well supported and can create maximum benefit to the organization, here are some things to consider if you haven't already.

### Who
The participants of your event, and whether there are any restrictions or limitations that need to be considered (e.g. the space is not wheelchair accessible). And while it is good to create events that everyone can come along, you'll often find that for workshops it is best to limit the number of people so that you can provide the best experience for all the participants.

We encourage both events for members only (to add more value to the membership) and for the general public (because we like sharing what we do to a wider audience), and events can be either free or paid (separate processes apply).

### Where
The upstairs area where the main work area with the tables have been used to host meetup events (e.g. Home Automation Meetup), but be aware of how much space you'll need to take up and whether this is going to be available (e.g. if you want the workshop to be in a quiet space, the meeting/recording room has limited capacity).

The downstairs area will be more suited to other types of events and workshops, but some extra precautions will need to be taken if you decide to host the event (need more info here).

### When
To avoid potential time and resource clashes, it is important to plan ahead so you can find the best time to run the event.

Even for one-off events, it is still good to go through the entire process and plan things out correctly so that you can get the full benefit of running the event. It will then serve as another example for people who want to pick up and continue running these events, or to scale it up.

If you are planning a regular or recurring event, consider the amount of time and resource it will take (for you and for BMS), and be prepared to make adjustments accordingly based on interest and attendance.

### What
If you are considering hosting a meetup event, first consider if there are already similar events running (you may even have attended ones before) and if you want to offer something exactly the same but at BMS, or if you would like to offer something different.

If you are considering running a workshop, first consider your level of expertise on the subject matter and experience with teaching (often they are not at the same level) and make use of your fellow members to get feedback on any aspects of the workshop that you may not be comfortable with.

### Why
Whether you want to connect with like-minded people and talk about things of common interest, or just share your passion and knowledge of something valuable to learn, or if you want to help create a more vibrant makerspace, it is good to remember your starting motivation for hosting an event. 

This is because the success of the event doesn't really depend on the turn out the first time (or the last time) you run it, but whether it is something that you are happy to do because you believe it is worthwhile. Of course, an event without anyone is a solo project, so you should also be prepared to make adjustments and pivot as required (and hopefully still make it align with your goals and motivation).

## Why is HOW here?
Because it is worth taking the time to consider all of the above first so that the rest of the steps will make more sense and be easier to complete.

1. Check the shared calendar from the member portal for conflicts before deciding when to host an event. Avoid Sunday mornings and Thursday evenings as we often run paid public workshops then.
2. If you haven't already, [complete a volunteer agreement](/howto/volunteer-agreement) so you can get the right permissions below.
3. Before you can create an event, request permission in the Discord **#volunteers** channel to manage events on our:
    - [Discord](https://discord.brisbanemaker.space)
    - [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/brisbanemakerspace)
    - [Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/brisbane-makerspace/)
    - Google Calendar ([get access to our shared google calendars](/howto/manage-shared-google-calendars))
    - Canva ([get access to our canva](/howto/canva))
4. Use the event template on Canva to create graphics for all the different platforms. Direct links to each template are below:
    - Event Cover for Facebook, Discord & Meetup
    - Instagram "Square"
    - Instagram & Facebook Story

5. Add the event and all the associated details as a:
    - BMS Google calendar event
    - Discord event
    - Facebook event
    - Meetup event (optional)

6. BMS is a non-profit and usually can't afford to cater events. For major events or working bees, please raise a motion at a general meeting to approve a budget for catering. Generally we will approve a budget for Domino's value range pizzas up to 3 pizzas per expected attendee and allow free soft drinks from the vending machine.
7. If you are running an event or workshop for the first time, it is always a good idea to do a 'dry run' to iron out any potential issues. Best time to do it is on the same day but a week ahead so you will likely come across the issues that might come up on the actual day.

## On the day of the event
### Setting up
Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get to the event as often there are people who turn up early (sometimes 15+ minutes early). If you have things to prepare before the start of the event, then you'll need to give yourself more time.

We recommend that you create a runsheet in the shared Google Drive folder to make the day easier to run in the future, and so someone can step in if you become unavailable.
### House keeping
These are mandatory things that **must be covered** at the beginning of **every event**:
- Acknowledgement of Country
    > We acknowledge the Yuggera and Turrbal peoples, the Traditional Custodians of the Country on which we meet, and pay our respect to Elders past, present and emerging. Sovereignty has never been ceded.
    {.is-info}

- Safe space affirmation
    > Brisbane Makerspace is a safe space. We do not tolerate discrimination or other behaviour that makes any person feel unsafe. Our [code of conduct](/bylaws/coc) and [safe space policy](/bylaws/safespace) applies to this and all our events.
    {.is-info}

- Location of
		  - emergency exit (main door)
      - emergency evacuation point (rear carpark)
		  - shared bathroom
      - WiFi details and encourage to join discord (signs above bin) 
      - vending machines (if catered)

### Safety & other incidents
If any incidents occur during the event or workshop, usual processes apply regarding the reporting of incidents. In an emergency always call 000 and when safe to do so, call the emergency/lockouts number and post an update in Discord.

### Packing up
And the end of the event, follow any cleanup or closing procedures as required. Don't forget to thank all the participants and invite them to join Discord and like our social media pages.

## After the event
There are some useful activities to do after the event, which will help with creating a positive social and learning environment at BMS.
- Follow up on anything that the participants might have asked about (if you weren't able to do so during the event).
- Do a [retro](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/teamwork/run-retrospective-distributed-team-fun) while the details are still fresh in your head. Ask everyone the following questions, and decide on any "action items" that should be followed up on.
      - Liked (let's keep doing these things)
      - Loathed (let's stop doing these things)
      - Longed for (I wish we did these things)
      - Learned (key things I learned about)
      - Actions (things we need to do as a result of the retro discussion)
- Make any updates or changes to the event as required (don't leave it until the day before the next one).
