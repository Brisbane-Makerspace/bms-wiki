# How to manage our appointment booking system
We have our own instance of `cal.com` that manages all of our bookings for things like onboarding inductions, tours, tool inductions, and tool bookings. 

Members shouldn't need to access to this system. You only need access if you're a volunteer who members can book time with. For example, you're volunteering to help run the onboarding induction or a tool induction.

# You've already created an account
## Login
[Tap here](http://appointments.brisbanemaker.space/) and then click "Login with member portal"

## Update Availability
[Tap here](https://appointments.brisbanemaker.space/availability) then tap on "Working Hours". Don't forget to save!

# You've just been invited
1. Ignore the email invite. Pretend it doesn't exist. Send it straight to the trash can. ;) 
2. [Tap here](http://appointments.brisbanemaker.space/) and then click "Login with member portal".
3. You will be prompted to finish creating an account after login. Before going through the steps, read all of these instructions.
4. Create your username with the format `firstname-lastname` then tap "Update".
5. Set your full name as you want other members to see it then tap `Next Step  ->`.
6. Connect all of the calendars you want the system to use to check for conflicts.
		**Note:** members nor admins can see events - the system just uses this to avoid double bookings. You need to link at least one calendar that the system can add new bookings to.
7. When the system asks to "Connect your video apps" tap on "Set up later".
8. Select what times you want to be available for members to make bookings and tap next. 
		**Note:** We put restrictions on how often people can book inductions (typically each tool is 1/week) so don't worry about this. If you don't want to be available on a specific date or need a break, you can update this at any time.
9. Once you get to the final page, click `Finish ->`.
10. Turn off the default event types on the next page you see by turning off the check toggle (you'll see a 15 Min Meeting and 30 Min Meeting by default).
11. [Tap here](https://appointments.brisbanemaker.space/teams) or tap on "Teams" in the menu then tap on the `Accept` button to join the team.
12. Keep an eye out in your emails and calendar for new appointment bookings.

# Invite a new member
1. Navigate to the team in the admin dashboard and click "Members" in the left menu. For example, `https://appointments.brisbanemaker.space/settings/teams/2/members`
2. Click `Add +` at the top right, and use the same email the member has registered in the member portal.
3. Select invite as "**Member**" (normal members should not be given admin).
4. Tell them to ignore the signup email, and send them a link to this wiki page. Ask them to follow the "*You've just been invited*" section.

# Create a new bookable tool
1. Tap on "Teams" in the menu on the left.
2. Tap on "+ New" in the top right.
3. Use the tool name as the "Team Name" and tap "Continue ->".
4. Tap "+ Add team member" then add `booking@brisbanemaker.space` as an **Owner**.
5. Tap "Finish ->" then tap "<- Back" in the top left to go back to your dashboard.
6. Tap "+ New" in the top right to create a new event type for the team you just created.
7. Make sure you configure it as below, but obviously make any changes as reasonably necessary.
