# How to use our Canva account
Because we're a charity, we get free access to Canva. To get access to Canva, you need an *@brisbanemaker.space* google account setup for you. To get one of these google accounts, you need to have a volunteer agreement in place.

If you've got an *@brisbanemaker.space* google account, or once you get one sorted, follow the steps below.

## Login to Canva
1. Go to https://www.canva.com and click the login button at the top right of the page or download and open the mobile app.
2. Tap the "Continue with Google" button and select your *@brisbanemaker.space* account from the list, or login.

3. Once you've logged in, you must accept this prompt. If you accidentally close it, please ask for help in Discord.

4. Once you've accepted the prompt, you'll have access to two teams. Your "Personal" team can be used however you like, but does not have access to canva premium features. To access the BMS brand templates, shared designs, and premium Canva features, you need to switch to "BMS Team".

## Using the Canva account
> Important: every design in the Canva team can be seen by any BMS member with access to Canva. Non BMS/personal use is discouraged and you must follow the rules below.
{.is-warning}

1. Even though you have your own login, BMS Team is basically like a giant shared folder that everyone in our Canva account can access. Always keep this in mind and make good choices.
2. When you upload a new asset or create a new project, **always move it to a relevant folder**. Ask for help in Discord if you're not sure how. This should be a folder with your own name, or the relevant BMS folder if one exists.
3. Do not, under any circumstances, modify an existing template or brand colour pallete/logo. The only people authorised to do this are the committee, and people the committee have authorised. If you're not sure if that's you, please ask.
