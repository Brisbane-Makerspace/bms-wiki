# How to get a volunteer agreement
A volunteer agreement is a slightly formal way of tracking how our volunteers are going and help the head maker keep track of everyone's commitments. They aren't a legally binding contract, or meant to pressure a volunteer into doing something.

Volunteer agreements are simply a tool that allows expectations to be managed by both BMS and our volunteers. They are also a requirement to become a voting member.

## How do I get one?
It's really simple! Just contact the head maker (email, discord, or in-person) and ask for one.

The only thing that's required is you have to commit to doing something regularly for BMS. This could be helping run a monthly event, agreeing to take the bins out once per week, or running a fortnightly induction for one of our tools.


## What does it look like?
Every volunteer agreement is unique and there's a lot of flexibility on what it looks like. Some people commit to weekly things, others might be less frequent like a monthly event or things done on an "as-needed" basis. Once you have a volunteer agreement, the head maker should check in with you about once per month, but this may be less often.

We expect volunteers to commit around 4 hours per month for a volunteer agreement. If you can't commit that much that's cool! You can keep volunteering, it's just not really suitable for a volunteer agreement.

However, they all follow a simple template which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j4uo2ywQSAdiKKS2O1WN24rCbL0MExUuz3wpnZFn6AU/edit).

## Do I need an agreement to volunteer?
Definitely not! If you can't commit to a regular volunteer activity, you don't need a volunteer agreement. Login to our task tracker [here](https://tasks.brisbanemaker.space/login) or ask in Discord if you want something to do. 

Volunteer agreements are mainly for people who want to become voting members or can commit to helping out more regularly.
