# Shared Google Calendars
We have various shared calendars that members can use to help plan their time at BMS. Only authorised volunteers and our booking system can create/edit calendar events. If you find any problems, please let us know on Discord or report an issue via the member portal.

## Combined View - You probably want this one
To see *all* of our calendars combined together, open the "BMS Calendar" from the member portal:
https://portal.brisbanemaker.space

This is what you use to check what's going on around the space and what events/bookings might be happening. All of the individual calendars from below are visible on the main "BMS Calendar".

## Individual Calendars
The links below will allow you to add the individual calendars *directly to your google account*. You probably don't want to do this unless you want them to show up inside the Google Calendar app on your phone etc. If you're logged into multiple Google accounts, it may be a little tricky to add it to the right one. After the page loads, close the confirmation popup, then switch account from the profile picture in the top right. Once this loads, you can confirm the new popup.

Please use your **@brisbanemaker.space** account if you need to manage events otherwise you won't have permission. **Do not** make changes to bookings or events managed by our booking system.

**Public Events:** https://bms.wiki/calendar-public-events
These are always free and open for anyone to attend - including non-members usually.

**Private Events:** https://bms.wiki/calendar-private-events
These require booking directly with the member/third party running them and are usually paid.

**Laser Bookings:** https://bms.wiki/calendar-laser-bookings
All bookings for the laser cutter appear here. Workshops usually book out the laser, but if they don't, they can still request you don't use it during the workshop.
