# How to become a voting member at BMS
When your membership at BMS is accepted, you become a formal member of an incorproated association called *Meanjin Makerspace*. We normally use the public trading name *Brisbane Makerspace* or *BMS* for short.

You are automatically accepted as a *standard member*. This means you get full access to everything at BMS (in accordance with our policies). You are also welcome to attend general meetings, but you don't get voting rights straight away.

We use a voting system called [*consensus decision making*](https://wiki.brisbanemaker.space/constitution#h-37-consensus-decision-making). This means a single member can block a motion from passing. This has the potential to be misused and also takes a while to get used to. This means you need to meet a few requirements before you can become a voting member.

## Requirements
The requirements to become a voting member are set out in our constitution [here](https://wiki.brisbanemaker.space/constitution#h-5-classes-of-members) and summarised below. Members with voting rights are called a *Volunteer Member* in the constitution.

You must meet **all** of the requirements below to apply for voting rights.

1. Held membership of the association for at least 6 months.
	a. This ensures that you understand how our organisation works and how to use our [*consensus decision making*](https://wiki.brisbanemaker.space/constitution#h-37-consensus-decision-making) process.
  b. You can check how long your subscription has been active in the member portal [here](https://portal.brisbanemaker.space/account/membership-plan).
2. Have in place a signed volunteer agreement committing to perform certain volunteer task(s). Read more [here](/howto/volunteer-agreement).
	a. This ensures that you have an up to date understanding of our organisation and are actively contributing to it.

## The Process
Once you meet the requirements above, you can apply to become a voting member. A motion just needs to be passed at a meeting to make you a voting member and that's it! This can be done at a committee meeting or a general meeting.

The general best practice is to ask a voting member to do this for you at a general meeting. You don't need to be present, but it's highly encouraged! If you don't know anyone well enough to do this, we recommend coming along to some of our events like our open nights.

If you can't get someone to raise a motion at a general meeting, you can also ask someone on the committee to do it at the next committee meeting.
