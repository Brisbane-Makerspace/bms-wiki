# How to find the right person to contact
There are lots of people that make BMS run, and finding the right one to contact can sometimes be tricky! Here's an attempt to keep an up to date list, and give some guidance on how to find the right person for your question, query or concern.

> If you have a complaint about an individual person or another member, do not post publicly on Discord or the member forum. Please send an email directly to [committee@brisbanemaker.space](mailto:committee@brisbanemaker.space) for help.

## The Committee
These volunteers are responsible for specific areas of governance and operations as explained below. If your concern doesn't fall into one of these areas, keep reading.

### President
The president is responsible for governance of the organisation and can help with questions about community engagement, culture and general direction of the association.

#### Current President
Jaimyn Mayer ([president@brisbanemaker.space](mailto:president@brisbanemaker.space))

### Treasurer

### Secretary

### Head Maker

### General Positions

## Other Contacts
### Less important questions/concerns
Generally, the best way to find the right person to contact about casual or less important things is by posting in Discord. For example, infrastructure problems like wifi and swipe card glitches should be reported in the #infrastructure channel or help with a woodworking tool in the #woodwork channel.

> If you don't have access to Discord [tap here](discord.brisbanemaker.space) for the invite link.

### Serious or important questions/concerns
For serious or important issues, like contacting someone about a safety incident, raising a complaint, questions about your membership, or problems with another member, you should contact the committee directly. You can send the committee and email at [committee@brisbanemaker.space](mailto:committee@brisbanemaker.space).
