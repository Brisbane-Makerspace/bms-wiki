## Other Contacts
### Less important questions/concerns
Generally, the best way to find the right person to contact about casual or less important things is by posting in Discord. For example, infrastructure problems like wifi and swipe card glitches should be reported in the #infrastructure channel or help with a woodworking tool in the #woodwork channel.
