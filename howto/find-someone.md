# How to find the right person to contact
There are lots of people that make BMS run, and finding the right one to contact can sometimes be tricky! Here's an attempt to keep an up to date list, and give some guidance on how to find the right person for your question, query or concern.

> If you have a complaint about an individual person or another member, do not post publicly on Discord or the member forum. Please send an email directly to [committee@brisbanemaker.space](mailto:committee@brisbanemaker.space) for help.

**Note: unsolicited commercial contact using these contact details is prohibited.**

## Time Sensitive / Emergencies
You can contact the head maker and commitee via phone for **emergencies** and **time sensitive** concerns that require an immediate response. Our phone number can be found on our website and on signs next to each external door on site. This number rings a few different people, so be patient as it may take a couple minutes for a volunteer to answer.

The following are **good** reasons to call us:
* There is a medical, fire, or safety incident happening on site.
* Emergency services or someone with legal authority to enter the site needs access (e.g. paramedics, a government inspector, etc.).
* You are locked out because the access system has failed.
* You are locked out because you left your swipe card inside and can't get home because your keys are also inside. ([lockout fees](/bylaws/fees) apply)

The following are **bad** reasons to call us:
* You are locked out because you didn't bring your swipe card. ([lockout fees](/bylaws/fees) apply)
* You can't find a certain tool or you can't work out how to turn it on.
* You want to book an appointment, have questions about membership, etc.
* Anything that doesn't have to be dealt with *right now*, and could be sent in an email or Discord message instead.

## Other Contacts
### Less important questions/concerns
Generally, the best way to find the right person to contact about less important things is by posting in Discord. For example, infrastructure problems like wifi and swipe card glitches should be reported in the #infrastructure channel or help with a woodworking tool in the #woodwork channel.

> If you don't have access to Discord [tap here](discord.brisbanemaker.space) for the invite link.
