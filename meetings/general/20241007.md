## Agenda

### 1. Acknowledgement of Country

> We acknowledge the Yuggera and Turrbal peoples, the Traditional Custodians of the Country on which we meet, and pay our respect to Elders past, present and emerging. Sovereignty has never been ceded.

### 2. Safe Space Affirmation
> Brisbane Makerspace is a safe space. We do not tolerate discrimination or other behaviour that makes any member feel unsafe. Our code of conduct and safe space policy applies to this and all meetings.

### 3. Confirmation of Previous Meeting's Minutes

**Motion: The minutes of the 15th General Meeting be accepted by the committee as true and accurate. Motion raised by Adam Jacobus. Motion seconded by Y. Motion failed/carried with consensus.**

### 4. President’s Report


### 5. Treasurer’s Report


### 6. Secretary’s Report


### 7. Head Maker’s Report

**Motion: The Committee Member's Reports are accepted by the committee. Motion raised by Jaimyn Mayer. Motion seconded by Y. Motion failed/carried with consensus.**

### 8. Purchase of a Water Filter for the Air line of the Laser Cutter

- Buy a decent water filter for the laser cutter so we can stop blowing through lenses so frequently. The cyclonic style ones that spin the water out seem most suitable - don’t really want one with a filter cartridge unless it can be re-used.

**Motion: The Head Maker investigate and purchase an appropriate water filter with a budget of $300. Motion raised by Jaimyn Mayer. Motion seconded by Y. Motion failed/carried with consensus.**

### 9. Changes to Section 5(2)(4) of the Constitution

- Remove section 5(2)(4)(1) and 5(2)(4)(2) as below

> 4. must meet the following requirements:
>     1. ~~held membership of the association for at least 6 months; and~~
>     2. ~~requires a motion to be passed at an executive or general meeting supporting the application to become a Volunteer Member; and~~
>     2. have in place a signed volunteer agreement committing to perform certain volunteer task(s).

- This means the only requirement would be to have a signed volunteer agreement in place. We can create another policy to manage this or add extra requirements if we like, after the constitution is changed.

**Special Resolution: The association accepts the above amendment to the rules. Motion raised by Jaimyn Mayer. Motion seconded by Y. Motion failed/carried with consensus.**

Meeting adjourned at X pm.
