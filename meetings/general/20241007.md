### 8. Purchase of a Water Filter for the Air line of the Laser Cutter

- Buy a decent water filter for the laser cutter so we can stop blowing through lenses so frequently. The cyclonic style ones that spin the water out seem most suitable - don’t really want one with a filter cartridge unless it can be re-used.

**Motion: The Head Maker investigate and purchase an appropriate water filter with a budget of $300. Motion raised by Jaimyn Mayer. Motion seconded by Y. Motion failed/carried with consensus.**

### 9. Changes to Section 5(2)(4) of the Constitution

- Remove section 5(2)(4)(1) and 5(2)(4)(2) as below

> 4. must meet the following requirements:
>     1. ~~held membership of the association for at least 6 months; and~~
>     2. ~~requires a motion to be passed at an executive or general meeting supporting the application to become a Volunteer Member; and~~
>     2. have in place a signed volunteer agreement committing to perform certain volunteer task(s).

- This means the only requirement would be to have a signed volunteer agreement in place. We can create another policy to manage this or add extra requirements if we like, after the constitution is changed.

**Special Resolution: The association accepts the above amendment to the rules. Motion raised by Jaimyn Mayer. Motion seconded by Y. Motion failed/carried with consensus.**

Meeting adjourned at X pm.
