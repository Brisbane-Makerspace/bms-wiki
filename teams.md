# Teams
Teams are an important part of how BMS runs and is how we manage different areas of the organisation. The [Teams Policy](/policies/teams) provides a loose set of guidelines for each team. However, each team is free to make their own rules and operate in a way that works best for them.

This page documents all of the current and past team operations pages. These team operations pages are a simple document that explains why a team exists, what it's goals are, how it plans to achieve them, and how is part of that team.

# Current Teams
These teams are currently in operation! If you want to help a team achieve it's goals, jump into it's operations page to learn more about how it runs.

* None currently!

# Past Teams
These teams are no longer in operation. If this is due to a lack of volunteer time, we encourage you to put your hand up to revive a team. Please check it's operations page for information about why this team isn't running any more.
