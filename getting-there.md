# Getting There
There are several ways to get to the makerspace. We generally recommend the use of public transport or personal mobility devices like escooters, bicycles, etc. due to our inner city location.

# Public Transport
We recommend that you use Google or Apple Maps and enter "**Brisbane Makerspace**" as your destination. Select public transport and you'll see the best route from a combination of train and bus options.

The closest train station is *Fortitude Valley*, which is a very short 5 minute walk. There are also lots of nearby bus stops with frequent services. If you can't use Apple or Google maps, we recommend the official [Translink Journey Planner](https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/journey-planner).

# Car & Motorbike Parking
### Member Car Parking
There is limited on-site parking available to **members only**, as per our [parking policy](/policies/parking) (booking required).

### Public Car Parking
For members of the public, or members' guests, we recommend parking at [Cathedral Place](https://goo.gl/maps/LE3iVDVs6yrzeh1e7). This is just across the road and parking is only $5 after 5pm on weekdays.

If you want a more price concious option, there is street parking nearby, but it may be tricky to find depending on the time of day. There are a few spots around Gotha St, Agnes St, and Warren St that are free - but please check council signage to confirm.

### Motorbike Parking
There are lots of free and unlimited motorbike parking spaces right at our backdoor! If you have a bike or scooter, this is a great option. These are not on site, but about 20m away from our own carpark entrance.

### Central Parking Area
We fall within the council's "Central Parking Area". This means that between 7am to 6pm Mon-Fri, and 7am to middday Sat, a 2 hour limit applies to all street parking that doesn't have a sign saying otherwise. Learn more on the council website [here](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/parking-in-brisbane/parking-permits/brisbane-central-traffic-area).

This means if you park somewhere without a sign (saying what the time limit is) between those times, you may get fined for staying longer than 2 hours! Feel contact the council or our staff if you need assistance with understanding this.
