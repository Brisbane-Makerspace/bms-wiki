## Policies
1. You must be authorised (in writing) by this team to make any modifications to infrastructure defined in the team areas section above.
2. All assets defined in the "Team Areas" section are considered assets that require induction for the purposes of other policies. You may request to become inducted once you have demonstrated competence and trust over a reasonable length of time. *Being part of this team does not give you permission to modify any infrastructure if you have not been inducted.*
3. Infrastructure maintenance and upgrades should be done during periods of low utilisation to minimise impact where reasonable/possible.
4. Members should be given as much warning as possible for outages caused by planned maintenance or upgrades.

## Budgets
